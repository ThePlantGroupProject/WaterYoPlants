 Aluminum Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pilea cadierei 
 Showy, silver-splashed leaves make Aluminum Plant a stunning and popular house plant. It's easy to grow, too, as 
 long as you can meet its need for humidity. 
 Pilea cadierei 
 is a fast-growing perennial plant. It spreads rapidly in its tropical native habitat, where it grows 
 as a groundcover. Tiny, light-colored flowers sometimes appear in summer. Don't be afraid to pinch them off. 
 They're insignificant compared to the foliage. 
  
  
  
  
 Its ovate green leaves are about 3 in (8 cm) long. Silvery streaks mark each leaf, adding a dramatic metallic 
 design to its quilted texture. These unusual patterns give this plant another common name, watermelon pilea. 
  
 Caring for Aluminum Plant: Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Pinch off growing tips 
 to keep the plant from getting leggy. Pinch the fleshy stems early and often to encourage them 
 to branch out and to stay compact. Don't toss out those cuttings, either. They'll root easily. (See "Propagation" below.) 
 Plant wilting? 
  Aluminum plant prefers humidity to wet soil. 
  In fact, it won't tolerate soggy soil which causes root rot. Aim to keep the soil 
 lightly moist during the growing season. 
 Leaf drop? 
  Older stems will drop its lower leaves. This is normal. Cut back older stems in spring when they become leggy. 
 If your plant drops quite a few leaves, it's likely caused by overwatering. Move the plant to a warmer spot and stop 
 watering until the soil dries out a bit. If you believe you've hopelessly overwatered, repot at once in fresh soil. 
 Repot in spring 
  when it outgrows its pot. Use a pot with a hole to provide good drainage. If you want to use a cachepot (a decorative planter without drainage holes), just slip the plain nursery pot inside the cachepot. I put small river rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the pots above the drainage water. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  It's a good idea to check your plant for  
 aphids 
 . These pests are attracted to soft, new growth on plants. They feed by sucking sap from the plant, then secrete sticky honeydew, which left untreated promotes black, sooty mold on the leaves. Remove any part of the plant that is badly infested and treat with an insecticide. 
 Is 
 Pilea cadierei  
 poisonous? 
  No -- according to the ASPCA, this tropical plant is non-toxic to cats and dogs. 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 You'll find this tropical native for sale at nurseries and online in spring and summer. Look for the botanical name 
 Pilea cadierei 
 to be sure you're getting this plant. 
 Pinch off the growing tips to keep it small. It makes an ideal dish garden or terrarium plant. 
  
  
 Aluminum Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Vietnam 
 Height: 
 Up to 12 in (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light. The foliage will lose its variegation if the light level is too low. It's a good 
 idea to place it in bright, filtered sunlight year-round. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. 
 Overwatering will cause leaves to wilt or fall off. 
 Use a pot with drainage holes and allow soil to dry out a little between waterings. 
 Keep slightly drier in winter. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (at least 50% relative humidity). To raise humidity, place the plant on a tray of wet pebbles or near a cool-mist room humidifier. This plant 
 also loves to be misted with room-temperature water. It makes an ideal  
 terrarium 
 plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C year-round. This tropical native doesn't like the cold at all. Keep it away from drafts and AC/heat vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix with added perlite for faster drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended strength. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. Cut the stem just below a  
 node 
  -- 
 the place where a leaf is attached. Place the cut end in moist potting mix and cover the plant with a plastic bag to retain humidity. For best results, use a  
 heat mat 
  to maintain an even 70°F/21°C temperature. 
 Cuttings root easily in a month.

 Areca Palm Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Dypsis lutescens 
 Long, feathery fronds of areca palm tree grow in a canopy shape, lending an air of elegance and sophistication to a room. 
  
  
  
 Give areca palm a whirl -- and add a tropical vacay vibe to any room. 
  
 Not all palms adapt well to home conditions, but this Madagascar native does beautifully indoors. Give areca palm tree bright, indirect sunlight and you'll enjoy it for many years. 
  
 Repotting Areca Palm: When, Why and How-tos 
  
 Don't be in a hurry to repot your palm.  
 Your new palm. 
  Did you just bring it home? 
 Palms are stressed from a change in light and humidity. 
 Give it a month or so to adjust to its new environment. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, slip it into a  
 cachepot 
  -- a decorative container without drainage holes. I put river rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Keep it crowded. 
  
 Crowding its roots will help to limit this large palm's size, which is a good thing because you're growing it indoors. 
 Repotting areca palm tree only necessary every 3 years, and only when its roots are severely crowded.   
 Repot in spring. 
  The best time to repot is in spring, when this palm begins its most vigorous time of growth. 
  
 Use a pot only 2 inches bigger than the old one, because a too-large pot will hold too much water and may lead to root rot. It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil. 
 Keep the palm at the same depth as it was in the old pot; planting it too deeply will likely cause the stems to rot, killing the plant. 
 Don't spread out the roots because this palm's roots are brittle and break easily. Try to keep the root ball intact as much as possible. 
 Gently tamp the potting medium around the root ball. 
 Water thoroughly to ensure all the roots are wet. 
 When your palm reaches 3 ft (90 cm) or taller, you can top-dress it instead. 
  
 How to top-dress a plant: 
  Remove the top 2-3 inches of soil and replace with fresh soil every couple years. Take care not to harm any roots near the surface. 
  
  
 Where to Buy Areca Palm Tree 
  
 You'll find areca palms for sale in nurseries, florist's shops and garden centers. This is one of the most popular palms for growing indoors. If you can't find one locally, you'll find them for sale online. Look for the botanical name 
 Dypsis lutescens 
 (also known as  
 Chrysalidocarpus lutescens 
 ) to be sure you're getting this palm. Common names include Areca Palm and Butterfly Palm. 
  
 You'll find  
 Areca Palm Tree 
  for sale at Real Palm Trees, a company I trust. Guide-to-Houseplants.com is a participant in the affiliate program offered by Real Palm Trees. If you make a purchase after following this link, I may earn a commission. 
  
 Areca palm adapts beautifully to growing indoors and is a long-lived houseplant. 
  
 Areca Palm Tree Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Palm tree too big? 
 Although slow growing, areca palm tree can reach 20-30 ft in its native habitat. Indoors, this tree will slowly reach about 8 ft (2.4 m). You can keep it smaller by pruning off the tallest frond or two. You can also limit its growth by confining its roots in a smallish pot. 
  
 Brown leaf tips? 
  Dry air or dry soil is probably the culprit. Water regularly and boost the humidity around your palm tree. You can trim off brown leaf tips with scissors if you don't like the way they look. 
 Brown fronds? 
  Older fronds will turn brown. You can cut them off near the soil level. 
 Something bugging your palm? 
 Dry air may attract 
 spider mites 
 to areca palm leaves. Wiping off leaves with a damp cloth will do double-duty, removing dust and keeping those pests away. Raising the humidity can also help. Treat any infestation right away to prevent pests from moving on to your other houseplants. 
 Is areca palm poisonous? 
  No. It's non-toxic and safe for a home with children, cats and dogs. 
  
 Areca Palm Tree Care 
  
 Origin: 
 Madagascar 
 Height: 
 About 6-8 ft (1.8 - 2.4 m) tall when grown indoors in a container 
 Light: 
 Bright (indirect) light year-round. Give your plant a quarter turn every few days to expose all sides to light for even growth. If you move the palm to your patio for the summer, keep it shaded from full sun. Hot, direct sunlight may turn leaves yellowish-green. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly to wet all the roots, then allow soil to dry slightly before watering again. Water less in winter when growth has slowed. 
 Use filtered or distilled water because tap water may contain fluoride, chlorine and other chemicals that can damage palms. 
 When watering, avoid getting the base of the palm wet to prevent rot. 
 Use a container with drainage holes, and fast-draining potting mix to prevent soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40-50% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry in the winter. The most efficient way to increase humidity is with a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . Your tropical plants will love it, and it's good for you, too. 
 Temperature: 
 70-85°F/21-27°C days; 55-60°F/13-16°C nights. Cold blasts from doorways as well as drafts from heat/AC vents can harm this tropical native. 
 Soil: 
 Mix 2 parts peat moss-based potting mix and 1 horticultural sand 
 Fertilizer: 
 Most indoor plants like a steady diet of liquid plant food, but 
 not 
 palms. Palms are 
 slow-growing, especially indoors, and aren't heavy feeders. Feed monthly spring and summer with a  fertilizer specially made for palms, such as Jobe's Organic granular fertilizer; it 
 contains the micro-nutrients this palm needs to keep it lush and green. Yellow spots or streaks indicate a lack of potassium or magnesium. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow seeds in spring, barely covering the seeds with soil. Keep them warm (75-80°F/24-27°C) 
 and moist. Seeds can take up to 6 weeks to germinate, so be patient.

 Arrowhead Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Syngonium podophyllum 
 Arrowhead Plant is a member of the Araceae family -- along with the philodendron -- and is 
 just as easy to care for. Give it bright light and lightly moist soil, and you'll find that 
 it's otherwise low-maintenance. 
 Commercial growers have made big improvements to this beautiful foliage plant in recent years, giving it a better resistance 
 to disease. And that's not all. Today's plants offer more leaf colors with heavy variegation and a compact growth habit, adding to 
 its appeal. 
  
  
  
  
 As a young plant, its leaves start out heart-shaped, then gradually become arrowhead shaped as it matures.  
 S. podophyllum 
  dark-green leaves 
 have silvery white or cream variegation, making this a decorative and popular house plant. 
 There are many named varieties. Choose a plant based on the color and size you want. 
 Among the most popular are  
 'Butterfly' 
  that features deep-green leaves with creamy white veins... 
 'Pixie' 
  is a compact cultivar with small leaves... 
 'Imperial White' 
  is stunning with green 
 leaves marbled with white. Some newer cultivars are flushed with pink. 
 Display arrowhead plant alongside a group of other foliage plants or add it to a dish garden. Small plants mix well 
 with compact peace lilies and English ivy because they require similar care. 
  
 Young plants form clusters of upright stems, with climbing stems developing later. Use a moss stick to support older stems, 
 giving aerial roots something to hold onto. 
  
 Pruning tip: To keep arrowhead plant bushy and full, prune out the older, climbing stems as they grow. Cut them back in early summer and you can propagate the stem tip cuttings. 
  
  
 Dropped or shriveled leaves? 
  Arrowheads are always growing new leaves, but may drop them if 
 the plant gets too dry. Cut off dry, shriveled leaves and aim to keep the potting mix lightly moist at all times. 
 Brown, shriveled leaves 
  could indicate chemical damage. Arrowhead plant's thin, delicate leaves are sensitive to 
 leafshine products, pesticides and pollutants. 
 If leaves are dusty, clean them with a fine spray of room-temperature water. Before using any pesticide, 
 read the label to be sure it is safe to use on this plant. 
 Repot in spring 
  every couple years, or when the plant becomes root-bound. 
 Use a container with drainage holes. If you want to dress up a plain pot, slip it into a cachepot. I put pebbles in the bottom of cachepots to hold the inside pot above the drainage water. As the water evaporates, it adds humidity to the air around your arrowhead plant --  
 and it will love the humidity 
 . 
 Is arrowhead plant poisonous? 
  Yes. 
 Syngonium podophyllum 
  has sap that contains calcium oxalate crystals and is toxic to pets and people and can cause skin irritation. 
 I recommend wearing gloves when handling this plant or washing hands thoroughly afterward.

 Arrowhead Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
  Newer compact varieties grow to 2 ft (60 cm), some varieties climb to 4 ft (1.2 m) or more. 
 Light: 
  Bright light, but no direct sun. 
 Syngonium podophyllum  
 can 
 tolerate low light, but the leaves may lose their variegation. 
 Turn pot in front of window regularly for even growth. 
 Water: 
  Keep the potting mix moist in summer, allowing the surface to dry out before watering again. 
 Water less often in winter, letting the top half of the potting mix dry out. 
 Humidity: 
  Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity around your plant. Brown leaf tips can be caused by dry air. Take a look at these easy ways to  
 increase the humidity 
  for your tropical plants. 
 Temperature: 
  Warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C). 
 Soil: 
  Peat-moss based potting mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite for good drainage, such as African violet mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
   Feed every 2 weeks from spring through fall with a balanced house plant fertilizer 
 diluted to half the normal strength. In winter, feed monthly. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-4 in (7.5-10 cm) stem tip cuttings early in summer. For best results, dip the cut end 
 in  
 rooting hormone powder 
  then stand the cutting in a pot of perlite or a half-half mix of vermiculite and peat moss. 
 Keep the cuttings out of sunlight and maintain the humidity around them by covering the pot with a plastic bag. 
 Cuttings should root in about a month.

 Care of Asparagus Fern 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Asparagus densiflorus 
  'Sprengeri' 
 Asparagus Fern is not a true fern, but a member of the lily family (Liliaceae). 
 Long, arching stems densely covered with short, needle-like leaflets give this plant a delicate appearance. It 
 has a cascading habit that makes it ideal for a hanging basket. Or set this ornamental trailer on a multi-level  
 plant stand 
 . Its feathery foliage blends in beautifully with other humidity-loving house plants.

 Mature plants will bloom in summer with tiny, white-to-pale pink flowers hidden among the needle-like foliage. Flowers are sometimes followed 
 by clusters of green berries that turn red in the winter. These berries are poisonous if eaten. 
 Florists love the feathery, emerald-green foliage in bouquets. It's also a popular outdoor container plant in temperate 
 climates. If planted in the ground, asparagus ferns are invasive. In their native habitat, these vigorous plants will spread across 
 -- and scramble up -- other plants. 
  
 Asaparagus Fern To-Dos, Problems and Answers 
  
 Prune it back. 
  Trim off older, bare stems in the spring to make room for new growth and to keep the plant looking neat. 
 Repot in spring 
 . Move to a pot only 1 size larger. Allow 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) from the surface of the potting mix to 
 the rim of the pot. The fleshy, tuberous roots sometimes force the potting mix up as they grow. 
 Yellow leaflets 
  are typically caused by soggy soil or a plant that's not getting enough sunlight. 
 Leaf drop 
  is usually a symptom of too much sunlight -- or, more likely -- dry soil. Keep your asparagus fern 
 where it'll get filtered light. Water regularly, but take care not to overwater. The plant's thick, tuberous roots 
 store water and soggy soil can cause root rot. 
 Spider mites 
  may attack plants that grow in dry conditions. They are true spiders, but only about the size of pepper flakes, so you can barely see them. The first tale-tell sign of these 8-legged critters is webbing between stems. 
 Treat any infestation right away. Here's  
 how to get rid of spider mites 
  on houseplants. 
 You can discourage these pests by maintaining humidity around your plant. 
 Is Asparagus Fern poisonous? 
  Yes -- according to the  
 ASPCA 
 , this member of the Liliaceae family is toxic to cats and dogs. Its red berries are the most toxic, causing stomach upset. 
  
 Asparagus Fern Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  Trailing stems up to 3 ft (90 cm) long 
 Light: 
  Bright, indirect light year-round. Give your plant a quarter turn every week or so for even growth. If you don't have a window available, this fern grows beautifully under artificial light. Set plant 8 to 12 inches below light source for 14 to 16 hours per day. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, allowing soil to dry out a little between waterings. Water sparingly in winter, but do not allow 
 soil to dry out completely. 
 Humidity: 
  Prefers moist air. 
 Dry indoor air will cause this plant to shed its small leaflets.  
 Set pot on a tray of wet pebbles and mist leaves daily with room- 
 temperature water 
 to keep the 
  
 humidity 
  
 high (around 40% relative humidity or higher). 
 Temperature: 
  Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C). This plant will tolerate a minimum temperature of 
 50°F/10°C. Keep this plant away from heat/AC vents that may cause it to dry out. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced house plant fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  This is an easy plant to grow from  
 seeds 
 . Divide overcrowded plants in spring. Ease the plant out of its container and divide the plant with a sharp knife, keeping as much of the roots attached as possible.

 Peperomia Obtusifolia - Baby Rubber Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Peperomia obtusifolia 
 Baby Rubber plant is growing in popularity and it's easy to see why. Its thick, waxy leaves and upright growth habit give it this common name, though it is not related to the large Ficus plant.  
 It's a stand-out among your other houseplants, but this small Peperomia looks good on a table all by itself, too. Or take it to work with you. Because of its easy-going nature, this tropical evergreen also makes a beautiful office plant. 
  
  
  
  
 The rounded leaves are traditionally dark-green, although newer variegated types are the most sought-after. For the most handsome leaves, look for varieties marbled with golden yellow or creamy white. 
  
 Problems with Peperomia Obtusifolia 
  
 Problems are few, however this jungle native will protest cold, wet conditions. 
 Dropped leaves? 
  Temperatures below 55°F/13°C may cause the lower leaves to fall off. 
 Variegated leaves that turn green 
  are not getting enough sunlight. If you don't have a spot near a window, a small grow light will work wonders. 
 Wilted leaves 
  are likely from overwatering. Soggy soil will cause the roots to rot, but all you'll notice are the limp leaves. Use a pot with drainage holes. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, slip it into a  
 cachepot 
  (a decorate planter without drainage holes). I put small pebbles in the bottom of my cachepots to keep the pot above the drainage water. 
 Notice  
 dry, corky scabs under the leaves 
 ? That's also caused by overwatering. The problem is more common in winter, when growth has slowed and the plant doesn't drink up as much water. Cut back on watering. If you think you've hopelessly overwatered your plant, repot it right away in fresh potting mix. 
 It's normal for older leaves to die. But if you see a lot of 
 dry, shriveled leaves 
 , 
 it may be caused by excess soluble salts from fertilizer. You can easily flush built-up salts by slowly pouring room-temperature water over the potting mix a couple times. 
 Wondering whether to repot 
 ? Peperomia obtusifolia can stay in the same small pot for a few years. If you like, you can repot in spring just to freshen the potting mix. Keep the potting mix loose -- don't pack it down because the roots need air as well as water. 
  
 Peperomia Obtusifolia Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
  Up to 10 in (25 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, but no direct sun. Small leaves or leggy stems indicate the plant is not getting enough light. Variegated types will lose their color in low light. 
 Water: 
  Keep potting mix lightly moist spring through fall. Allow surface to dry out before watering again. Water sparingly in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (at least 50% relative humidity). Set plant on a tray of wet pebbles or use a  
 cool-mist humidifier 
 . Brown leaf tips are a sign of dry air. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). Cold air may cause its leaves to fall off, though it will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C in winter. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Take stem tip cuttings in spring and early summer. Or take leaf stem cuttings in spring. It roots easily in moist perlite or potting mix.

 How to Grow Baby's Tears 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Soleirolia soleirolii 
 Baby's Tears plant gets its name from the tiny, round leaves cascading down slender, fragile stems. 
  
  
  
  
 Other common names for this plant include: Mind-Your-Own-Business and Irish Moss. 
 This fast-growing evergreen has a low, spreading habit that spills beautifully over the sides of a container. It 
 won't grow far though, because the creeping stems need to have contact with the soil. 
 Given enough light, it may produce tiny, single flowers in the leaf axils. It typically blooms in summer. 
  
 Growing in a thick mat of tiny leaves, this captivating plant loves moisture. 
  
 Although this creeping plant seems well-suited for the moist environment of a terrarium, it is invasive and will crowd other plants. I'd recommend 
 putting it in its own pot. Trim with scissors any time to keep it under control. 
 Repot 
 S. soleirolii 
 in spring, when it outgrows its pot -- a wide, shallow pot will do. It makes a beautiful 
 groundcover when planted under tall potted plants; however, it's a good idea to combine Baby's Tears with plants 
 that prefer constant moisture. 
 If you just can't walk past a plant without fussing with it, this one is for you. Water it, mist it, and prune it to your heart's content. 
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 Baby's Tears is formerly known as  
 Helxine soleirolii 
  and is still sometimes labeled by growers with that name. 
 Don't be afraid to buy a small plant, this one grows fast. 
 Some colorful varieties are available.  
 'Aurea' 
  has golden-green foliage...  
 'Variegata' 
  has silvery green 
 variegated leaves. 
  
 Baby's Tears Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Italy 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 in (15 cm) 
 Light: 
  Will grow in low light, but prefers bright, indirect light. Keep out of direct sun, which will scorch the leaves. 
 Water: 
  Keep the potting medium moist at all times. It will not tolerate dry soil. 
 Humidity: 
  
 This plant thrives in high humidity. 
 Check out these easy tips for  
 raising the humidity 
  for house plants. 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C 
 Soil: 
  Any good potting mix; African violet potting mix works well to maintain moisture which this plant craves. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through summer with balanced water-soluble houseplant fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Baby's Tears has shallow roots and can be propagated by division. Divide plant into smaller clumps by gently pulling it apart. Be sure there are roots attached. You can just set the separated plants on top of potting medium, water, and they'll readily take root.

 Bird Nest Fern 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Asplenium nidus 
 Bird Nest Fern is one of the easiest types of ferns to grow indoors. This tropical native is fast-growing and will live 
 for many years with good care. 
 In its natural habitat, this fern grows as an  
 epiphyte 
  (a plant that grows on trees) in the warm, moist, tropical rain 
 forests. Despite its tropical beginnings, Bird Nest Fern adapts well to being a house plant. Place your potted fern where it is out of 
 direct sun and away from drafts, which can scorch the fronds.  
 Provide humidity 
  
 and you'll keep it healthy. 
  
  
  
 Those fronds can reach 4 ft (1.2 m) long in its native habitat. 
  
 This unique fern grows in the form of a deep rosette of large, shiny, spear-shaped fronds. New fronds unfurl from the center of 
 the plant. Its fronds are fragile, so I'd put this fern where passersby won't brush up against it. 
  
  
 This tropical fern gets its name from the unfurled fronds in the center of the plant that look like a nest. 
 In its native habitat, those fronds quickly reach 4 ft (1.2m) long. 
  
  
 Bird's Nest Fern Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 As Bird Nest Fern ages, the oldest, outer fronds will turn brown. This is normal. You can cut them off at the base to 
 keep the plant looking neat. 
 Those upright fronds tend to be dust-catchers. Keep the broad, shiny fronds dust-free by spraying with water and gently wiping them with a damp cloth. 
 Never use leafshine products on ferns because it can severely damage their delicate fronds. 
 Repot young plants in spring, every couple years or when the roots fill the pot. 
 If you find that the roots are attached to the pot, run a knife around the inside to loosen them before you can remove the rootball. You may need to break the pot to remove it. It's a good idea to u 
 se a container with drainage 
 holes to avoid soggy soil. Take care not to pack down the potting mix; this fern likes a loose mixture. 
 This fern's problems are few. Watch for  
 scale insects 
 , 
 that look like small, brown discs on fronds. If you find an invasion of these pests, 
 spray with soapy water followed by clean water. Don't use insecticides on ferns because they are easily damaged by chemicals. 
  
 Bird Nest Fern Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia and Tropical Australia 
 Height: 
  2 ft (60 cm) in a container indoors 
 Light: 
  Give your plant bright, indirect sunlight. No direct sun, which can scorch the fronds. Give the pot a quarter turn each week for even growth. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist. Water the potting mix, not the center of the rosette, otherwise it can easily rot. 
 Water less in winter when growth is slower. Yellow fronds are often a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
  This tropical fern likes moist air. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a  
 humidity tray or cool-mist room 
 humidifier 
  to add moisture to the air around the fern. Brown leaf tips are a sign of dry air. 
 Temperature: 
 Slightly cool to average room temps (60-75°F/16-24°C) suit this tropical fern just fine. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer at half strength. 
 Propagation: 
  This fern is propagated by spores, which is difficult to do for the home grower.

 Growing Boston Ferns Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Nephrolepsis exaltata 
 Boston ferns are the most popular of the fern species that originated in Central America and became a 
 fast favorite in parlors and porches in North America during the Victorian era. 
 Long, arching fronds densely covered with leaflets -- called  
 pinnae 
 -- makes this lush, graceful house plant ideal for a 
 pedestal 
 or a  
 hanging basket 
 .

 Buying Boston Ferns 
  
 Garden centers display hanging baskets of ferns in spring and summer. You may find ferns for sale at online flower shops, too. 
 Look for a fern with new fronds unfurling from the center -- a sure sign of a healthy plant. 
 Today, there are several new cultivars that are getting attention, including 'Fluffy Ruffles' with curly fronds and a dwarf variety 
 'Timii' that makes an elegant table accent. 
  
  
  
 Caring for Boston Fern Indoors 
  
 Caring for Boston ferns is easy, as long as you meet their need for high humidity. Ferns are native to tropical rainforests, 
 where the relative humidity stays well above 70%. Short of turning your home into a misty rainforest, there are a few things you can 
 do to  
 raise the humidity 
  for your plant. 
 Brown leaflets 
  -- or  
 pinnae 
  -- are often caused by dry air. Avoid placing your fern near a heat or AC vent 
 because fluctuations in temperature can shock the plant and also cause browning of leaflets. Some browning of frond 
 tips is normal. You can trim brown leaflets with scissors, if you want, to keep it looking neat. Older, lower fronds will 
 naturally turn brown when they die and should be cut off. 
 Fronds that are yellow 
 and wilted are a sign of overwatering. Reduce amount of water and trim off damaged fronds. 
 Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. Check the plant's 
 roots to see if they have rotted. If the roots are mostly black,  
 get rid of it 
 -- it's too far gone. 
  
 Repot in spring 
 , when the roots have filled the container. Move the fern to a pot that's only slightly larger. 
 Want to control its size? Remove the fern from its container and prune off about 1/4 of its roots. Then repot 
 it in the same pot it was in before. This is a good time to divide the fern, if you want. 
 Are Boston ferns poisonous to cats and dogs? 
  No. According to the ASPCA, this common fern is non-toxic to pets. 
 A couple pests 
  bother this fern. Watch for  
 scale 
 , 
 that look like small, brown discs on leaflets. (Sometimes the brown spores on the undersides of leaflets are mistaken for 
 scale insects. You'll recognize the spores because they appear in two rows under each pinnae.) To remove scale insects, 
 scrape them off with your fingernails. Don't use insecticides on ferns because they are easily damaged by chemicals. 
 Spider mites 
  are less common, but can cause more 
 damage. Fine webbing between fronds are a sure sign of this destructive pest. Cut off badly affected fronds. Don't use 
 an insecticide, which can damage fronds. If it's warm enough, you can take your fern outdoors to wash it off with tepid water 
 to dislodge these mites. Otherwise, place your fern in the shower. 
 Misting your fern regularly will prevent an invasion of spider mites that prefer drier conditions.  
 And your fern 
 will love the humidity 
 . 
  
 Boston Fern Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Central America 
 Height: 
  Fronds are generally 1-3 ft (30-90 cm) long. 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. No direct sun. Give the plant a quarter turn every week or so to expose 
 all sides to light. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil constantly moist, but not soggy. Watch large ferns and hanging basket ferns because they can dry out quickly. Wilted or drooping fronds are caused by either under- or over-watering. Always use room-temperature water for your houseplants; Cold water is a shock to these tender tropicals. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain moist air (around 40-50% relative humidity) near the fern. Use a  
 room humidifier 
  for best results. Misting with room-temperature 
 water helps, if you can mist a few times a day. 
 Temperature: 
 Normal room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Or half-half mixture of peat moss and all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks year-round with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Division. You can cut away new plants that grow outside the main root ball and 
 pot them separately. Or divide a large root ball into smaller clumps with a sharp knife and pot them up.

 Pteris cretica: Brake Fern Houseplant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Pteris cretica 
 Brake Fern adapts well to average indoor conditions, earning it another common name: Table Fern.

 Pteris cretica 
  is easier to please indoors than some other ferns. It does require bright light, so don't put it in a 
 dark corner. Set this handsome foliage plant on a table or  
 plant stand 
  near a window to give it the sunlight it craves. Its fronds are 
 somewhat fragile, so it's a good idea to keep this fern where passersby won't brush against its foliage. 
 Repot in spring 
 , only when it gets too crowded. Brake Fern is slow-growing and prefers to be pot-bound. 
 Keep the crown of the plant above the soil line when repotting, and use a pot with a drainage hole to avoid soggy soil. 
 Prune it. 
  Keep it compact 
  by cutting off tall fronds at the base. New ones will grow to take their place. 
 Keep it cool. 
 Cool nights and moist air will keep this small fern healthy indoors. Hot, dry air will make the fronds 
 turn yellow. Cut off yellow fronds at the base. 
 Pteris cretica 
  is long-lived and gaining in popularity as a house plant. This decorative fern has an interesting fountain shape and unusual foliage, making it a beautiful addition to any brightly lit room. 
  
 Brake Fern Varieties 
  
 Many different varieties are available and they vary in leaf shapes and variegations. 
 There are dozens of cultivars to choose from. 
 Pteris cretica 
  
 'Albolineata' 
 sports creamy white 
 stripes down the center of its leaves. 
 P. Cretica 
  
 'Victoriae' 
 has silvery white stripes, giving it the common name Silver Brake Fern. 
 P. Cretica 
  
 'Cristata' 
 has frilly tips. 
 All make attractive accents for a room.

 Brake Fern Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Southern Mediterranean 
 Height: 
  6 in to 2 ft (15 cm - 60 cm), depending on the variety 
 Light: 
  Give your fern bright (indirect) light year-round. It also thrives under  
 fluorescent light 
 . 
 Water: 
  Keep the potting mix lightly moist at all times. This Mediterranean fern needs slightly less water 
 than its rainforest cousins, so take care not to overwater. 
 Humidity: 
  Prefers 50% relative humidity. When air gets dry in winter, set pot on a tray of wet pebbles or use a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool nights (50-55°F/10-13°C) and warm days (60-70°F/16-21°C) will make 
 Pteris cretica 
  feel at home. 
 Soil: 
  Any good-quality potting mix with added perlite for good drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Brake ferns aren't heavy feeders, but they do need a regular weak water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season. Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced house plant fertilizer at half the manufacturer's recommended strength. 
 Propagation: 
  Division. Divide large plants in spring only when crowded -- this fern is 
 slow-growing and rarely needs divided.

 Button Fern House Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pellaea rotundifolia 
 Button fern is a dependable plant that grows well indoors with little care. 
 Arching fronds densely covered with small, round leaflets makes this New Zealand native an eye-catching 
 accent for any brightly lit room. 
 Place this fern on a plant stand among other tropical plants or put it in a hanging 
 basket and allow the trail of leathery, button-shaped leaflets to cascade over the side. 
 You may find  
 P. rotundifolia 
  in garden shops in spring and summer, although it's not as easy to find 
 as other types of ferns. If you come across this fern, buy it. With good care (it's easy) you'll 
 enjoy it a long time. 
  
  
  
 Caring for button fern is easy. Unlike most ferns, 
 Pellaea 
 tolerates fairly dry conditions. 
 One thing this fern won't tolerate is soggy soil. 
 Repot in spring 
 , when the roots have filled the pot. Move the fern to a pot that's only slightly larger. 
 Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil. This is a good time to divide the fern, if you want. 
 Shed some light 
 . Keep this evergreen in bright, indirect light and constant room temperature. It won't go dormant. With 
 consistent care, it will grow year-round. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  are caused by high temperatures (above 75°F/24°C) or dry air. Trim off dry leaflets and 
 raise the humidity around your plant. 
  
 Button Fern Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  New Zealand 
 Height: 
  Up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, but no direct sun 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, then allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out  
 slightly before watering again. Fronds that are yellow and wilted are a sign of overwatering. 
 Cut back on water and trim off damaged fronds. Check the plant's roots to see if they have rotted -- 
 if they're mostly black, 
 get rid of it 
 . It's too far gone. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high (around 40-50% relative humidity). Raise the humidity around your fern with a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  or set the plant on a wet pebble tray. 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based potting mix with added perlite or sand to help drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly year-round with a 20-20-10 water-soluble fertilizer at half strength. 
 Propagation: 
  Division. In spring, divide the plant into 2 or 3 sections with a sharp knife 
 and pot them up. Be sure to get roots with stems attached. Fern spores can be propagated, but germination takes 
 a few months and is not always reliable.

 Fancy-Leaf Caladium Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Caladium 
 plant spp. 
 The paper-thin, heart-shaped leaves of this tropical native are spectacularly decorated, enough to rival even 
 the showiest flowering plant. 
 Masses of magnificent leaves grow above tall, slender stems. And they are big, growing about 12 in (30 cm) long. Leaf patterns and colors can vary widely, from white with green veins and borders, to a blush of rose pink, to spotted and marbled red, pink, green, and white. 
 Caladium thrives indoors in indirect light, making this South American native a spectacular tropical accent for your home. You can expect the showy season to last for 6 months or longer. 
  
  
  
 Caladiums thrive in warm, moist conditions. Give them bright, indirect light and humidity. 
  
 Caladium Varieties 
  
 There are hundreds of Caladium varieties 
 to please everyone, so choose the one you like. Some named cultivars include: 
 'White Christmas' 
 has striking 
 white foliage with green veins, blending beautifully among your green foliage plants. 
 'Florida Cardinal' 
  is a stand-out with vivid red leaves. 
 'Pink Beauty' 
  is a perennial favorite among gardeners. 
 Spectacular  
 'Rosebud' 
  adds a burst of dramatic color to a container garden. 
 'Thai Beauty' 
  is one of the most stunning varieties we've seen. Petit  
 'Miss Muffet' 
  is a dwarf variety with red spots. 
  
 Caladium Bulbs for Sale 
  
 Although you can buy the plants at garden centers and nurseries, growing a caladium bulb -- called a tuber -- is 
 easy and rewarding. Buy tubers in spring and you'll have gorgeous leaves unfurling within weeks. 
  
 How to Plant the Bulbs 
  
 Grow caladiums in spring and summer. These South American beauties love the warmth and long daylight hours. They're warm-natured and will begin to grow as soon as you plant them -- no special treatment required. 
 Plant 
 the tubers in 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) pots, covering with just 1 inch (2.5 cm) of potting mix. Give them a good 
 drink of water, and keep them in a warm spot (about 75°F/24°C) with indirect light. You can expect those colorful leaves 
 to unfurl in 6-8 weeks.

 Overwintering: Caladium Dormancy 
  
 Caladiums break the rule that all foliage house plants are decorative year-round. This tuberous- 
 rooted hybrid dies down in fall and remains dormant through the winter. That fact -- together with 
 the need for high temperatures and high humidity -- leads to many of these plants being tossed out 
 after their first growing season. 
 However, keeping plants till the next year is easy. When the foliage dies down in the fall, allow the pots to dry out. Cut off 
 the withered leaves, then store the pots at 65-70°F/18-21°C in a dark place. In spring, repot the 
 tubers in fresh potting mix and continue with care. Tubers usually can be grown for a few 
 years before they deteriorate in quality. If the leaves are few and/or smaller than normal, it's time to replace them.

 How to Grow Caladium Plant Indoors 
  
 'White Christmas' is a much-loved cultivar. 
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
  Up to 2 ft (60 cm); dwarf varieties can vary, but reach about 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. Some direct morning sun is fine, but keep out of direct midday sun because it will cause leaf burn. Several hours of light each day will produce the biggest, showiest leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep potting mix constantly moist (but not soggy) throughout the growing season. 
 Check on it often -- a caladium plant can drink a lot. 
 Humidity: 
 Requires moist air (around 50% relative humidity or higher). Use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  for best results. 
 Temperature: 
  
 Brrr! 
  This South American native wants warm temps -- 75-80°F/24-27°C is ideal, but it will tolerate a range of 70-85°F/21-29°C. Protect caladium plant from blasts of cold air from AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a high-nitrogen liquid fertilizer, while plant is growing. 
 Propagation: 
  Division. When repotting, you can break off small tubers and pot them 
 separately. Put each tuber in a 4-in (10 cm) pot. Plant them 
 1-in (2.5 cm) deep.

 Calathea Orbifolia Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Brown leaf tips 
  are likely caused by dry air. This South American native thrives in high humidity. Short of turning your home into a misty rain forest, you do have a few options here. Bathrooms are sometimes a good location for tropical plants because of the high humidity; but only if it has enough light streaming in. A  
 room humidifier 
  works wonders, especially during the winter months, when indoor air can become extremely dry. 
 Leaves not unfolding? 
  Calatheas that keep their leaves folded up night  
 and day 
  are likely too dry. This rain forest native likes moisture -- don't forget to water and maintain humidity around it. 
 Wondering when to repot? 
  When your Calathea is crowded in its pot, the crown of the plant is pushing up out of the potting mix, or when you see roots growing out of the drainage holes, it is definitely time to repot. Spring is the best time, when your plant is beginning its most vigorous time of growth. Wait about a month before feeding a newly repotted plant; some roots will likely break while repotting and may get fertilizer burn. 
 Is  
 Calathea orbifolia 
  poisonous? 
  No, it is safe for cats, dogs and people. 
  
 Something Bugging Your Plant? 
  
 Webbing between leaves 
 is often the first tale-tell sign of 
 spider mites 
 . Unfortunately, these tiny critters will do a lot of damage, sucking sap from the undersides of the leaves. Left untreated, they multiply rapidly, causing leaves to look dry, and mottled with yellow spots. Spider mites prefer warm, dry conditions. Maintaining high humidity around  
 Calathea orbifolia 
  will do double-duty, giving this tropical plant the moisture it craves and discouraging an attack. 
 Consistently moist peat-based potting mixes attract  
 fungus gnats 
 . You may find these  
 tiny, fly-like pests hopping and crawling 
  on the surface of the potting mix. They're not particularly destructive, but they multiply quickly and will move on to your other indoor plants. 
 Aphids 
 are attracted to soft, new growth on houseplants. They're tiny -- sometimes green, black or gray -- and can be found along young stems and leaves. Sucking plant juices, aphids cause  
 new growth to curl, become distorted or discolored 
 . You may find honeydew -- a sticky excretion left on leaves or dripping off the plant onto furniture. Treat any infestation immediately.

 Calathea Orbifolia Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
  Up to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Moderate to bright, indirect sunlight. Hot, direct sun will cause leaves to turn brown. 
 Water: 
  Aim to keep the potting mix lightly moist; never allow it to dry out. It's a good idea to pot  
 Calathea orbifolia 
  in a container with drainage holes. Water thoroughly, then empty the drainage tray to prevent root rot. Avoid overwatering, which will cause crown rot. 
 Humidity: 
  Calatheas love high humidity, and this tropical houseplant is no exception. Try to maintain 60% relative humidity year-round. It's a good idea to use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 near your plant. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. It will tolerate a low of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
  Peat-rich potting mix; African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Division; divide large plants in spring.

 Calathea Ornata 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Calathea ornata 
 Calatheas are a gorgeous family of prayer plants, and  
 Calathea ornata 
  is tough to beat. Just look at that stunning silver pinstriped foliage. Those large decorative leaves fold up at night, exposing their reddish undersides. When you open your curtains or blinds in the morning, you can watch the leaves unfold. 
 The key to keeping this beauty happy indoors is to keep it moist, warm and near indirect light. Think about its native rain forest habitat, where it is bathed in a mist and 70°C/21°C temps nearly all year.  
 Short of turning your home into a misty rain forest, there are a few easy ways to boost the humidity for your tropical plants. You can set a small plant on a humidity tray. If your home is really dry (especially during the winter months) your best option is to use a room humidifier with a cool mist. 
  
  
  
  
 Calathea Ornata Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Brown leaf tips 
  are caused by dry air. This South American plant thrives in high humidity. You have a few options here. If your home is dry, use a room humidifier. Grouping tropical plants together creates a humid micro-climate. Bathrooms are sometimes a good location for tropical plants because of the high humidity; but only if it has enough light streaming in. It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge near Calathea ornata, rather than guess. Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter. 
 Leaves not unfolding? 
  Calatheas that keep their leaves folded up night  
 and day 
  are likely too dry. This rain forest native likes moisture -- don't forget to water and maintain humidity around it. 
 Leaf burn/dried leaves and stems 
  are sometimes caused by a buildup of mineral salts from fertilizers. You may also notice white crusty deposits on the surface of the soil. If you've overfertilized your plant, leach it by slowly pouring lukewarm water over the soil several times, allowing the water to drain out the drainage holes. Leaching once or twice a year will prevent unsightly leaf damage; it's easy to do and only takes a few minutes. Just do it -- you'll have a much healthier houseplant. 
 Webbing between leaves 
  is often the first tale-tell sign of  
 spider mites 
 . Unfortunately, these tiny critters will cause harm to your plant and often move on to your other indoor plants. Treat any infested plant immediately. Spider mites are attracted to dry conditions, making them more of a threat during the winter months when indoor air is dry. Raising the humidity will help to prevent them. 
 Wondering when to repot? 
  When your Calathea plant outgrows its pot, move it up to a pot 1- to 2-inches larger. Spring is the best time, when the plant is starting its most vigorous time of growth.  
 Don't overpot 
  -- a common mistake with houseplants. Why? A too-large pot will hold too much water, which may lead to root rot. Always use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Are Calatheas poisonous? 
  No, it's non-toxic, making Calathea ornata safe in a home with cats, dogs and people.

 Calathea Ornata Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Colombia, South America 
 Height: 
  Up to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright, indirect sunlight. Hot, direct sun will cause leaves to turn brown. 
 Water: 
  Aim to keep the potting mix lightly moist; never allow it to dry out. It's a good idea to pot your Calathea in a container with drainage holes. Water thoroughly, then empty the drainage tray to prevent root rot. Calatheas are sensitive to fluoride and salts in tap water, so I'd recommend using distilled water or rain water. Remember to always use lukewarm water when watering your houseplants; cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
  Prayer plants love high humidity, and this Colombian beauty is no exception. Try to maintain at 60-70% relative humidity all year. It's a good idea to use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. 
 Soil: 
  Peat-rich potting mix that drains well, such as African violet mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 N-P-K) water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Leaf cuttings can be taken in spring. Keep cuttings warm, moist and in indirect sunlight for best results. Clumps can be divided and potted separately. Calatheas are not easy to divide, so wait until the plant is large before you try separating it.

 How to Grow Calathea Lancifolia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Calathea lancifolia 
 This member of the Marantaceae family is called Rattlesnake Plant for its striking patterns. Long and narrow, the leaves have ruffled edges that are unique to this  
 Calathea 
  species. They are bright green with alternating dark-green markings down each leaf. The underside of the leaves are purple. Of course, they also fold up at night just like prayer plants. 
  
  
  
 Called Rattlesnake Plant for its distinct foliage, it makes a striking houseplant. 
  
 Growing Calathea Lancifolia Year-Round 
  
 Repot in spring 
 , every year or two to give your plant more room and also to give it fresh potting medium. Use a pot only 2 inches larger than the old one. Why? A pot that's too large will hold too much water and may lead to root rot. When repotting, keep the base of the plant at the same soil level as it was in the old pot. Potting it too deep may cause stem rot. 
 Keep it clean. 
  Large leaves tend to be dust-catchers. Wipe them off occasionally so they'll get the sunlight they need for photosynthesis. Hold your hand under each leaf to support it, while wiping off dust with a soft, moist towel. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  may be caused by excess salts in the soil (see "Flush salts" below) or dry air. Humidity can drop drastically in winter without your even noticing it. However, your tropical plants will notice. If your home is as dry as mine, use one of these easy ways to  
 add humidity for your houseplants 
 . 
 Flush salts. 
  
 Calatheas 
  are sensitive to fluoride and chlorine from tap water, plus the build up of salts from fertilizer. You've probably noticed white, crusty stuff on top of the soil on some of your potted plants -- either indoors and out -- that's an accumulation of soluble salts. It not only looks unsightly, it can damage your plant. You'll have a much healthier plant if you flush the soil once a year. It's easy, and takes just minutes to do. Here's how: slowly pour 
 room-temperature distilled water 
 over the soil. Allow the water to drain out the drainage holes. Pour more water through the pot, then empty the drainage tray.

 Calathea Lancifolia Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
 Brazil 
 Height: 
 2 ft (60 cm) tall 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect sunlight. No direct sun, which will cause brown scorch marks on its leaves. 
 Water: 
 Aim to keep the potting mix lightly moist; never allow it to dry out. Pot your  
 Calathea lancifolia 
  in a container with drainage holes. Water thoroughly, then empty the drainage tray to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot.  
 Calatheas 
  are sensitive to fluoride and chlorine in tap water -- use distilled or rain water. 
 Humidity: 
 Marantas love high humidity, and this Brazilian native is no exception. Try to maintain at least 50% relative humidity around your  
 Calathea 
  all year. It's a good idea to use a cool-mist room humidifier near your plant, especially in winter. Dry air may cause brown leaf tips. 
 Temperature: 
 Warm room temperatures (70-85°F/21-29°C) year-round. 
 Soil: 
 Peat-rich potting mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. Do not feed in winter. 
 Propagation: 
 You can divide plant when it gets big. The best time to divide is in spring, when it's starting its most vigorous time of growth.

 Calathea Roseopicta 'Corona' Prayer Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Calathea 
  roseopicta 'Corona' 
 'Corona' prayer plant deserves its place among the showy plants of the Maranta (Marantaceae) family. 
  
  
  
  
 'Corona' 
  is one of the most popular among the named varieties in the  
 Calathea 
  genus. Its handsome 
 markings and colors make it easy to see why. 
 Broad, silvery-green leaves taper to a point and are edged with a wide band of dark green. Even reddish-color mid-rib is distinctive on each leaf. 
 New leaves are curled as they emerge, showing their purplish red undersides. And like its family members, this 
 tropical foliage plant folds its leaves at night as hands in prayer. 
 Grown as an ornamental foliage plant, this tropical may also produce small white and purple flowers, emerging from green bracts. They are insignificant compared to the magnificent leaves. 
  
 Display Ideas: 
  Group calatheas with other humidity-loving plants, such as bromeliads 
 and ferns. Or show off a single plant by placing it on a  
 pedestal plant stand 
 . 
  
  
 Caring for Calathea Roseopicta 
  
 The secret to keeping it happy is to provide high humidity. 
 Brown leaf tips 
 indicate the air is too dry. Do anything you can to keep the relative humidity 
 above 50%. Place it on a humidity tray or use a room humidifier. 
 Calatheas 
 also love to be misted 
 with rainwater. 
 Repot  
 i 
 n spring 
  to give it fresh potting mix. Use a pot only 1-2 inches larger -- this prayer plant likes to be slightly pot-bound. Keep the crown of the plant at the same soil level as it was before. Need a new container? Check out stylish, new 
 house plant pots 
  here. 
 Leaves are naturally glossy.  
 Do not use leaf shine products 
 , because  
 Calathea 
 leaves are sensitive to chemicals. You can clean the leaves by gently wiping them with a soft, damp cloth. Hold one hand under the leaf as you wipe it off to avoid tearing the foliage. 
 Watch for  
 spider mites 
 . Dry indoor air in 
 the winter months encourages these pests to invade house plants, another reason to keep the humidity up. You'll 
 first notice faint webbing on the undersides of leaves. Don't use an 
 oil-based 
 insecticide on  
 Calatheas 
  because it will damage those beautiful leaves. And if your plant is badly infested, get rid of it. You don't want those harmful pests to invade your other houseplants. 
 Brown, curled leaves? 
  Older leaves will turn brown and shrivel up. This is normal. Cut them off with scissors or pruners to keep your plant looking neat. Newer leaves with brown edges, or crispy, curled leaves may be suffering from too much fertilizer. Flush the soil with tepid water to remove built-up salts. 
  
 Calathea Roseopicta 'Corona' Prayer Plant Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Central America and Brazil 
 Height: 
 Up to 18 in (45 cm) tall 
 Light: 
  Moderate to bright light. Avoid direct sun that will scorch the leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall. Water less often in winter, allowing the potting medium to dry slightly before watering again. Do not allow the soil to get soggy; over-watering may cause root rot and kill the plant. Use distilled water or rainwater 
 because this plant is sensitive to fluoride and salts in tap water. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high (around 50% relative humidity). A  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  works best. Or 
 set plant on a tray of wet pebbles. Mist its leaves with distilled water or rainwater (tap water with chlorine or fluoride can leave white spots on leaves) at room temperature. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-85°F/18-29°C room temperatures. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based potting mix, such as African violet mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a balanced NPK (such as 10-10-10) water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half. In 
 fall and winter, feed monthly. New leaves that emerge light in color may be lacking iron. 
 Propagation: 
 Division in spring or early summer. Ease plant out of its container and carefully separate rhizomes, ensuring that each plant has roots attached. Pot each division in its own container. Keep  
 Calathea roseopicta 
  shaded from sunlight and maintain humidity.

 California Pitcher Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Darlingtonia californica 
  
  
  
 California Pitcher Plant is a carnivorous plant that grows in bogs in its native habitat of Northern California and Oregon. 
 Because it is unable to get the nutrients it needs from the soil, it has developed a 
 way to feed from the insects it traps. 
  
  
 The long, tubular green leaves have prominent purple-red veins, made more prominent when exposed to bright light. 
 They arch at the top, so that the opening faces downward 
 like a hood. Hanging from these hooded tubes are forked leaves that look like serpents' tongues. The upright hooded tubes, 
 together with the "tongues", resemble cobras ready to strike, giving this menacing plant another common name,  
 Cobra Lily 
 . 
 This carnivorous plant lures insects inside its hooded opening with an intoxicating nectar. Once inside, insects 
 are trapped by tiny hairs that point downward in the tube, making it almost impossible for the prey to escape. 
 Once you understand its background, you'll understand California Pitcher Plant care. Provide the moist, nutrient-deficient soil and humid air like its natural habitat 
 to keep it healthy. This is one of the few plants I know that doesn't mind cold water. In fact, it prefers a cold drink. 
 Growing in a bog in the Northwest, it's watered by cold mountain streams and grows best when its roots are cold. If you like, 
 you can water by placing ice cubes (made from distilled or rain water) on top of the soil. 
 This is a perennial that can be kept from year to year.  
 California Pitcher Plant will go dormant in winter 
 for about 3-4 months. 
 When it dies down, cut off all of the dead pitchers, leaving a few young pitchers. Keep the plant lightly moist and cool during 
 dormancy, 
 with temperatures between 40-45°F/4-7°C. Moving it to a garage or basement for the 
 winter may be ideal...just be sure it gets some indirect light and the temperatures don't go below freezing. 
 New leaves will appear in early spring. You can divide and repot the plant when it starts coming out of 
 dormancy, but be sure to do this before vigorous new growth begins. 
  
 California Pitcher Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Northern California and Oregon, U.S.A. 
 Height: 
  Up to 12 in (30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light, but no direct sun. Plants grow well under  
 fluorescent lights 
 . 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist year-round. Because this plant is sensitive to chemicals in tap water, use only 
 distilled or rain water. 
 Don't allow the soil to dry out. If leaves become limp, it means that the soil is too dry. 
 Water thoroughly, although the plant may not recover. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (at least 40% relative humidity). Mist the plant every day or set the pot on a  
 tray of wet pebbles 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average room temperatures (60-75°F/16-24°C); In winter, a cold dormancy period is needed ( 
 40-45°F/4-7°C). 
 Soil: 
  Use a nutrient-poor medium because rich potting mix will harm its roots. You can plant it in live sphagnum moss, or 
 if that is not available, mix 1 part peat moss with 1 part perlite or horticultural sand. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Don't fertilize the plant. It makes its own food through photosynthesis when there are no bugs around. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide in spring when new growth begins. Can be grown from seed, but germination is slow.

 Cape Sundew 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Drosera capensis 
 Cape Sundew makes an eye-catching -- as well as  
 bug 
 -catching -- house plant for those looking for 
 a fascinating plant to play with. 
  
  
  
  
 This carnivorous plant grows in a rosette. Its long, narrow leaves are covered with bright red hairs 
 -- or tentacles -- which secrete a sticky juice, luring flies and other insects. 
 Fooled into mistaking that glistening liquid for nectar, bugs are attracted to them. As soon as a bug lands, it's 
 stuck and the leaf folds up to hold the insect. Sundew produces a digestive enzyme that breaks down 
 protein from the insect so that it can be absorbed by the plant. 
  
 Sow and Sow 
  
 Sundews produce seeds generously, and will even spread them around. Seed pods burst open, dropping seeds into the pot -- or any pot nearby where they readily germinate. 
  
  
 You'll get dozens of blooms from healthy, mature plants in early summer. (Plants reach maturity in about a year.) 
 Each flower stem carries several buds that open in succession, from bottom to top. The small, pink flowers are attractive, 
 though short-lived...each one lasting only a day. 
 Wait for flowers to dry and you can collect their seeds -- they're viable and ready to sow for more Sundews 
 (see "Propagation" below). 
  
  
 Feed me? 
  Sundews need to eat to survive and grow. They get all their nourishment from the insects they 
 capture. Since your carnivorous plant is unlikely to catch flies or other insects in the house, 
 you'll want to feed it. (Isn't that the fun of having this plant, anyway?) 
 Native to a subtropical climate, Cape Sundew prefers higher humidity than most homes provide. 
 It's a good candidate for a  
 terrarium 
  
 or  
 Wardian case 
 , which will help to maintain humidity. 
 This perennial  
 won't go dormant 
 in winter as long as its culture stays the same. 
 However, lower light levels and cooler temperatures can cause this carnivore to go dormant. If this happens, 
 don't give up on it. It'll grow new leaves and flowers when it gets what it wants. 
  
 Cape Sundew Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Subtropical Cape region of South Africa 
 Height: 
 Up to 3 in (8 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light 
 Water: 
 Aim to keep the potting medium evenly moist. Use rain water or distilled water. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, you'll want to 
 raise the humidity 
  for your plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C. It will tolerate a wider 
 range. Cold air may cause dormancy, so it's best to maintain normal room temps for it year-round. 
 Soil: 
  Live sphagnum moss or a half-and-half mix of peat moss and horticultural sand 
 Fertilizer: 
 Don't fertilize because it will burn the roots and may kill the plant. Since sundews are unlikely to 
 catch insects in the house, you can feed it dead flies spring through fall.  
 Don't 
  use flies that have 
 been exposed to insecticide because it will damage the plant. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds or division. Collect seeds from flowers that have dried and sow the fresh seeds in peat moss 
 (kept moist at all times). Place the pots in a warm window or under  
 fluorescent lights 
 . 
 Seeds germinate in about 2-4 weeks. To divide, separate new rosettes that form around the parent plant.

 Cardboard Palm Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Zamia furfuracea 
 Cardboard Palm Tree only  
 looks 
 like a palm. It's a Cycad native to Mexico and is much easier to please 
 indoors than a real palm because of its tolerance of dry air. 
 Place it in a sunny spot, and you'll find it needs little attention to thrive.

 This shrub-like plant is a semi-succulent that holds water in its thick trunk, so it won't mind if you 
 occasionally forget to water. Don't allow the soil to get too dry, though, or this plant may drop its leaves. 
 This potted palm is about as low-maintenance as you could hope for. You'll never need to prune, because it 
 grows in a rosette from the trunk, creating a full, leafy plant -- from the base to the top. The stems can grow 
 several feet long and are covered with thick, fuzzy leaves that feel dry and papery like cardboard. 
 Male or female cone-like structures will form on separate  
 Z. furfuracea 
 plants. Don't bother collecting 
 the seeds because they're not viable. (See "Propagation" below.) 
 Repot in spring when the plant becomes root-bound. Use a heavy container to prevent toppling, 
 because plants can get top-heavy. Older plants can be top-dressed instead by replacing the top 
 2-3 in (5-7.5 cm) of soil with fresh soil. 
 CAUTION TO PET OWNERS: 
 Unfortunately, the seeds of this beautiful plant are extremely poisonous. Keep the plant 
 away from children and pets. I've read several sad accounts from dog owners who lost their pets 
 after eating the seeds from this plant. 
  
 Cardboard Palm Tree Care 
  
 Origin: 
  Eastern Mexico 
 Height: 
 Grows slowly, but can reach up to 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun. 
 Turn the plant regularly in front 
 of the window so that it will grow evenly. Otherwise, the stems will grow toward the sunlight, creating a lop-sided plant. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly then allow top 2 in (5 cm) to dry out before watering again. Put it in 
 a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. Cardboard palm grows the most spring through fall, so cut back 
 on water in the winter months. Avoid getting water on the base of the plant or the foliage, which can cause this semi-succulent to rot. Water the potting mix only. 
 Humidity: 
 Average (around 30-40% relative humidity) or drier 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperature 65-75°F/18-24°C year-round. It's cold-hardy down to 
 25°F/-1°C, but prefers to be warm. 
 Soil: 
  Equal parts good-quality potting mix and sand for good drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once in spring and again in summer with a 
 time-release fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Buy good-quality seeds. Any seeds collected from 
 a mature plant are not fertile unless they are cross-pollinated. Use a  
 seedling heat mat 
  to maintain an even 70°F/21°C. Seeds are slow to germinate and seedlings are slow-growing. 
 Be patient, it'll take years for them to grow tall. Cardboard Palm seeds are poisonous and can be lethal to pets.

 Cast Iron Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Aspidistra elatior 
 As its common name suggests, Cast Iron Plant is tough. It will survive low light, infrequent watering and extreme heat 
 that would be deadly to most plants. 
 In fact, it practically thrives on neglect. Don't overwater -- it doesn't like soggy soil. And don't repot it very often 
 -- it doesn't like to be disturbed. Respect its Greta Garbo attitude and it will do just fine. 
  
  
  
  
 This plant grows slowly in a clump of 6-inch (15 cm) stems with glossy, dark-green leaves growing 24 inches (60 cm) long 
 and 4 inches 
 (10 cm) wide. 
 You can keep those shiny leaves dust-free by wiping them with a damp cloth. It won't really mind the dust, but you might. 
 Many named varieties are available.  
 'Starry Night' 
  has leaves speckled with yellow,  
 'Milky Way' 
  
 is speckled with white, and  
 'Variegata' 
  has creamy stripes down the leaves. 
 Small, unattractive, purplish-brown flowers may appear at the plant's base in spring. But, 
 don't expect them. Flowers don't appear often, and they're hardly noticeable. 
 Split and damaged leaves 
  may be caused by too much fertilizer. If leaves are starting to split, skip 
 feeding for a month, then resume feeding with a diluted amount. You can cut off badly damaged leaves at the soil level. 
 It's also a good idea to flush the soluble salts that build up 
 in the soil from fertilizers. Fortunately, getting rid of excess salts is easy. Here's how: 
  
 How to Flush Salts 
  
 Place your plant in a sink or take it outdoors on a warm day. 
 Slowly pour tepid water over the potting mix. Allow water to drain out the drainage holes. 
 Repeat a couple times, then empty the drainage tray. Flushing salts a couple times a year will 
 make your Aspidistra healthier and takes only minutes to do. 
  
  
 Watch for  
 spider mites 
  that may invade this plant. They're attracted to indoor plants, especially during the winter when humidity is low. 
 You'll first notice their faint webbing between leaves. Treat any infestation immediately. 
 Cast Iron Plant is evergreen and makes a beautiful, easy-care house plant year-round. Best of all, you'll enjoy it for many years. 
  
 Cast Iron Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  China 
 Height: 
   Up to 3 feet (90 cm). 
 Light: 
  Low to moderate light. No direct sun. Direct sunlight can cause brown scorched marks on leaves. 
 Water: 
  In spring and summer, water thoroughly, but allow soil to dry out before watering. Water less in fall 
 and winter when growth is slower. Yellow leaves are often a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
  Average (around 40% relative humidity). Will tolerate dry air, but keep plant out of drafts and away from heat/AC vents. 
 Temperature: 
  Adaptable to changing temperatures ranging from 50-85°F/10-29°C 
 Soil: 
  Any all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Do not feed at all in fall and winter, as plants grow very little during this time. 
 Propagation: 
  Divide in spring only when it gets overcrowded in its pot. A slow-grower, it probably won't need 
 divided more often than every 5 years. It's best to remove new shoots (with roots attached) and pot them separately than 
 to repot an old plant.

 Cat Palm Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Chamaedorea cataractarum 
  
 Cat palm tree makes a dramatic house plant and is easy to grow if you give it what it needs. 
 This lush, tropical palm will thrive in bright light. If you have a sunroom or a sunny window, keep it there. 
 Give your palm a quarter turn once a week so that all sides are exposed to sunlight. A large plant can be 
 placed on a plant caddy 
 to make it easy to move. 
  
  
  
  
 Cat palm trees are among the most popular indoor palms. The pinnate leaves have leaflets that will reach up to 1 ft (30 cm) long 
 and 1 in (2.5 cm) wide. 
 This palm needs more moisture than some. Water enough to keep the soil evenly moist, but never soggy. Palms are 
 not 
 desert plants as some people believe. Regular watering will help to prevent fronds from turning brown. 
 Brown leaf tips 
 can be caused by dry soil, dry air or tap water that contains fluoride. Increase humidity 
 around the palm, if the air is too dry. Use distilled or rain water to water your palms. 
 Palms are sensitive to salts that accumulate in the soil. This build up of 
 soluble salts come from the chemicals in tap water and fertilizers. They can damage foliage and roots. 
 Fortunately, getting rid of excess salts is easy. 
  
 How to flush salts: 
  
 Place your palm in a sink or take it outdoors on a warm day. 
 Slowly pour tepid water over the potting mix. Allow water to drain out the drainage holes of the pot. 
 Pour more water through the pot, then empty the drainage tray. Flushing salts a couple times a year will 
 make your palm healthier and takes only minutes to do. 
  
  
 Keep it clean. 
  Palm fronds tend to be dust-catchers. Wipe them with a damp cloth to keep them clean. Or clean the foliage with a warm shower: move your plant outdoors on a warm day and spray it with tepid water, keeping the palm out of direct sunlight. Allow it to dry outdoors in a shaded spot, protected from wind. 
 Something bugging your palm? 
  Dry indoor air sometimes attracts  
 spider mites 
  to indoor plants. These pests are about the size of pepper flakes, so you'll likely only notice their fine webbing between fronds and stems. Isolate any infested plant to prevent them from moving on to your other plants and treat it right away. Raising the humidity around Cat Palm in winter helps to prevent them. 
 Repotting your palm 
 is needed only every 3 years or so. Keeping the roots crowded helps to limit the plant's 
 size, so use a pot that's only a couple inches (5 cm) larger than the old pot. Don't pot the palm too deeply -- try to keep it 
 at the same depth as it was in the old pot to prevent stem rot. Also, don't try to spread out those roots. Palm roots are brittle, so keep 
 the root ball intact as much as possible. 
  
 Cat Palm Tree Buying Tips 
  
 Cat palms are among the most common palm house plants. If you can't find them locally, you'll find Cat palm trees for sale online. You'll sometimes find  
 the tag "Indoor Tropical Palms" stuck in the pot. 
 Look for the botanical 
 name 
 Chamaedorea cataractarum 
 to be sure you're getting this palm. 
  
 Cat Palm Tree Care 
  
 Origin: 
  Southern Mexico 
 Height: 
 Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors 
 Light: 
  Bright, indirect light, year-round. Keep it shaded from hot, direct midday sun in summer. Give your palm a quarter turn once a week to expose all sides to sunlight. 
 Chamaedorea cataractarum 
  responds well to artificial light, if you don't have room near a window. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist all year long. Put it in a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Palms don't like their feet wet. Tap water sometimes contains fluoride, chlorine or other chemicals that damage palms, so it's a good idea to use distilled or rain water to water your palm. Always use tepid water when watering your tropical house plants because cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
 Tropical Cat palm tree likes moist air. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a  
 cool-mist 
 room humidifier 
 . Cat palm also loves to be misted. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperature 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round. Keep 
 Chamaedorea cataractarum 
  away from cold drafts from doorways and heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
  Use a peaty mix that drains well. Mix 1 part sand to 3 parts African violet mix. 
  
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once in spring and again in summer with a time-release fertilizer. I like to use  
 Jobe's Indoor Palm Fertilizer Spikes 
 . 
It contains the micronutrients that palms need to keep them lush and green. 
  
 Propagation: 
  Palms can be grown from seeds, but seeds are slow to germinate and seedlings so slow-growing, 
you'll wait several years for them to grow into trees. Although Cat palms grow in clumps, I wouldn't try to divide them. 
Cat palm tree roots are fragile and are easily damaged by pulling apart the root ball.

 China Doll Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Radermachera sinica 
 China Doll plant is fairly new as a house plant. Introduced to garden centers in the 1980s, it quickly became popular 
 because of its tolerance to the warm, dry air of heated homes. 
 It's still in favor -- and it's easy to see why. Lush, emerald-green canopy of leaves cover this tropical beauty year-round. 
 If you're adding one to your collection (and you should) look for plants with stems that are covered with leaves from top to bottom. Skip a leggy plant -- a 
 sure sign of neglect. 
 Don't be afraid to buy a small plant, this one grows fast.

 A small, evergreen shrub, it has long, bipinnate leaves with glossy, deeply veined leaflets that are about 2 in (5 cm) long. 
 Young plants are compact with branching, woody stems. Fast-growing, this plant will quickly become leggy if not pruned back. 
 Pruning China Doll 
 will keep the plant compact and beautiful. Cut off as much as you need to in spring and summer. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Always prune above a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached 
 to the main stem). Use sharp pruning shears 
 to avoid tearing the woody stems. Also, pinch off growing tips 
 regularly to encourage the stems to branch out. 
  
  
 Will China Doll bloom? 
  In its native habitat of subtropical Southeast Asia, mature plants will produce fragrant, yellow bell-shaped flowers. 
 But plants grown indoors rarely flower. 
 Yellow leaves? 
  The keys to success with this China Doll house plant are plenty of bright, indirect light and consistently moist soil. Yellowing 
 leaves usually mean it has been overwatered. 
 Repot in spring 
 , only when its roots have filled the pot. Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, you can slip it into a  
 cachepot 
  -- a decorative container without drainage holes. I put pebbles in the bottom of cachepots to keep the pot above the drainage water. 
  
 China Doll Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  China and Taiwan 
 Height: 
  Up to 4 ft (1.2 m) indoors 
 Light: 
  Bright, indirect sunlight 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist year-round. 
 Don't allow the soil to become soggy -- or dry out. Either condition will 
 cause the China Doll plant to drop its leaves. Yellow leaves are a symptom of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40% relative humidity around your plant. Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter; it's a good idea to use a humidity monitor rather than guess. Use a humidity tray or a cool-mist room humidifier, if needed. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. It will tolerate a minimum of 
 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based mix with added vermiculite or perlite, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. Cut off lower leaves from the stem; use sharp pruners to cut them cleanly just above a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached to the stem). For best results, dip the cut stem tip in  
 rooting hormone powder 
  before planting. Insert the cutting into moist potting medium.

 Chinese Evergreen 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Aglaonema 
 hybrids 
 Chinese Evergreen is a member of the Aroid family ( 
 Araceae 
 ), known for easy-to-please foliage house plants. 
 A very adaptable plant,  
 Aglaonema 
  tolerates low light and dry air better than most other house plants. One thing it 
 doesn't like is cold air. Keep your plant away from drafts and A/C vents and it'll do just fine. 
  
  
  
 New hybrids offer more colorful choices, such as this red-splashed variety. 
  
 Its large, pointed, green variegated leaves are 6-10 inches (15-25 cm) long, 3-6 inches (7.5-15 cm) wide, and heavily marbled 
 with white, cream, silver or red.  
 New hybrids and cultivars are developed all the time, giving us more beautiful choices than ever before. 
 Newer hybrids of this plant grow in thick clumps, so mature 
 plants stay compact and bushy. 'Silver Queen' (shown at bottom) is a compact cultivar. 
  
 Air Cleaners 
  
 Chinese evergreens are among the best plants for removing toxins, such as formaldehyde, from tainted indoor air. As if their good looks weren't enough, their air-cleaning abilities make them must-have house plants. 
  
  
 Aglaonema Varieties 
  
 You have a wealth of varieties to choose from: 
 'Silver Queen' and 'Silver Spear' have silvery variegation that makes them stand out among group plantings. 
 'Emerald Star' has bright-green foliage speckled with creamy white. 
 'Silver Bay' is lavishly splashed with silvery green. 
 'Firecracker' is boldly mottled with fiery red. Choose the one you like, they all make eye-catching house plants. 
  
  
 Caring for Chinese Evergreen 
  
 Water regularly. 
 Consistently moist soil will keep this plant happy. In fact, it can grow in water alone. 
 Don't prune. 
 All new growth is from the crown of the plant, so don't prune it back or you'll kill it. If it 
 begins to look leggy, plant pothos -- or some other low-light plant -- in the same container to cover the bare stems. 
 Repot in spring 
  when it outgrows its pot.  
 Aglaonema 
  likes to be slightly root-bound, so it's a good idea to 
 move to a pot that's slightly larger. Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Check for bugs. 
   
 Scale insects 
  can weaken Chinese Evergreen, causing its leaves to droop. Look for these tiny, brown insects on stems and the undersides of leaves. Treat any infestation right away. 
  
 Is Chinese Evergreen poisonous? 
  Yes. Small flowers may appear in summer, followed by red berries. The berries and sap of this plant are poisonous. It's not a good idea to keep this plant where children and pets may play with or ingest it. 
  
 Chinese Evergreen Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
 Subtropical forests of Southeast Asia 
 Height: 
 2-3 ft (60-90 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light to low light. Keep it out of direct sunlight, which may cause its leaves to fade.  
 Aglaonema 
  grows well under fluorescent light, making it an ideal office plant. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, then allow surface of potting medium to dry out a bit before watering again. Keep it slightly drier in winter, when growth is slower. Don't allow it to get so dry that its leaves wilt. 
 Humidity: 
 Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity) or higher. Don't mist, which will cause spots on its leaves. It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor near your houseplant, rather than guess -- indoor air can become extremely dry during the winter months. The most efficient way to boost humidity is to use a 
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. 
 Aglaonema 
  has no tolerance for the cold. It suffers when exposed to temps below 
 55°F/13°C. Cold air may cause grayish-yellow patches on its leaves. Set your plant where it won't be exposed to 
 cold blasts from doorways and windows, or an AC vent. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose houseplant potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Chinese Evergreen is not a big feeder. From spring through summer, feed monthly with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble houseplant fertilizer, using half the recommended amount. Do not feed in winter, when growth is slow. 
 Propagation: 
 Easy to propagate by stem cuttings. Take 3-4 in (7.5-10 cm) long stem tip cuttings in spring. Dip the cut ends in water then rooting powder. Insert into sterile, moist potting mix. Keeping the plants warm and humid will improve successful propagation. Older root-bound plants can be divided.

 Grow Pilea Peperomioides Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pilea Peperomioides 
 This eye-catching tropical is sure getting a lot of attention. Once rare and hard to find, Chinese Money Plant has become a must-have houseplant. 
  
  
  
  
 Mounds of round, saucer-like leaves shoot out from a central unbranched stem. You don't need to prune it at all. In fact, this warm-natured West Indies native doesn't require much care. 
 You may see tiny, yellow-green flowers during the summer. But they're not very showy compared to the leaves. 
  
 Did you know? 
  
 This is a plant that keeps on giving. 
 Pilea peperomioides 
 readily grows offsets that can be separated and potted on their own. Or share them with friends. 
 See "Propagation" below. 
  
  
 Pilea Peperomioides Problems, Questions and Answers 
  
 Wondering whether to repot...or not? 
 Are there roots growing out the drainage holes? Sometimes you have to ease the plant out of its pot and take a peek at its roots. Are they coiled at the bottom? If so, it's definitely time to repot. Use a pot with drainage holes to avoid soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. If you want to use a decorative planter without holes, use it as a cachepot. Just slip a plain nursery pot in the cachepot. I put small river rocks in the bottom of my cachepots to keep the pot above the drainage water. This has the added benefit of raising the humidity around it -- 
 and your plant will love it 
 . 
 Leaves falling off? 
  
 Pilea peperomioides 
 will naturally lose a few leaves in winter. If it sheds more leaves than usual, it's likely caused by cold air or overwatering. Keep it away from drafts and heat/AC vents. 
 Keep it clean. 
 Wipe dust off leaves when needed with a soft, damp cloth. Dust can interfere with photosynthesis (that's how plants get the energy they need to grow). Don't use leaf-shine products. Those bright green leaves are naturally shiny and don't need it. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
 Growth slows down in the winter, so it's a good idea to allow the potting medium to dry out a bit between waterings. Keep plant in bright, indirect light and keep it warm year-round. 
 Is  
 Pilea peperomioides 
  poisonous? 
  No -- it's non-toxic, and safe for a home with cats and dogs.

 Pilea Peperomioides Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
 West Indies 
 Height: 
 Up to 12 in (30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light. The foliage will lose its bright green color if the light level is too low. It's a good 
 idea to place it in bright, indirect sunlight year-round. 
 Water: 
 Spring through fall, water thoroughly. 
 Use a pot with drainage holes and allow soil to dry out a little between waterings. 
 Over-watering will cause leaves to wilt or fall off. 
 Keep slightly drier in winter when growth is slower. Always use tepid water when watering houseplants. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate (around 40% relative humidity) or higher. If indoor air is dry in winter,  
 raise the humidity 
  around your houseplants. Brown leaf tips are caused by dry air. 
 Temperature: 
 Warm room temperatures 65-85°F/18-29°C year-round.  
 Pilea peperomioides 
  will tolerate a minimum temperature of 55°F/13°C in winter. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality peat moss-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. Cut the stem just below a 
 node 
 -- 
 the place where a leaf is attached. Nodes contain cells that will grow roots. Place the cut end in moist potting mix and cover the plant loosely with a plastic bag to retain humidity. 
 Cuttings root easily in about a month.  
 P. peperomioides 
  also grows offsets in abundance -- just separate them from the parent plant and pot them.

 Christmas Palm Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Veitchia merrillii 
  
 Christmas Palm tree is magnificent, adding a luxurious, vacay vibe to any brightly lit room. 
 This adorable palm looks like a miniature of the Royal Palm -- the stately giants you see lining boulevards 
 in South Florida and California. 
 It grows from a single trunk, which supports a crown of arched, pinnate leaves. At the base of the crown, 
 clusters of creamy white flowers emerge. In fall, these flowers are replaced with 1 in (2.5 cm) green fruits that ripen to  
 bright red around the end of December. They look like red Christmas lights, giving this stunning tree its 
 common name.

 This Southeastern Asia native is surprisingly tolerant of growing in a pot and will thrive indoors as long 
 as it gets plenty of sunshine throughout the year. 
 You can move this palm outdoors to the patio for the summer, 
 but bring it back inside if the temperature drops near 40°F. This tropical palm doesn't like the cold at all. 
 Repot in spring 
 only when the palm becomes severely root-bound. Pots should be deep enough to give roots 
 room to grow. Use a heavy pot -- although slow-growing, this palm will eventually get tall and become top-heavy. 
 Keep it clean. 
 Palm fronds tend to be dust-catchers. 
 Give them a shower: move your palm outdoors on a warm day 
 and spray it with tepid water. Allow it to dry 
 outdoors in a semi-shaded spot, protected from wind. 
 Check for bugs. 
  Dry indoor air sometimes attracts  
 spider mites 
 , especially during the winter months. You'll likely notice their fine webbing between fronds before you see these tiny pests.  
 Scale insects 
  are also attracted to palms; they are typically found on the undersides of frond leaflets. Treat any infestation immediately. 
 Christmas Palm was formerly known as  
 Adonidia merrillii 
 and is sometimes still 
 referred to by this name. It's rare and difficult to find outside of Florida, but you can buy  
 Christmas palm tree online. 
 Often sold as a single-stem palm, but sometimes 2 or 3 are grown together for a fuller look. 
  
 Christmas Palm Tree Care 
  
 Origin: 
  Philippine Islands 
 Height: 
  Up to 10-15 ft (3-5 m)  when grown in a pot 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full direct sun 
 Water: 
  Water regularly, but don't allow soil to get soggy which can cause root rot. Always use 
 a pot with drainage holes. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a  
 cool-mist 
 room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperature 65-75°F/18-24°C year-round; Christmas palm tree is not cold-hardy and will not tolerate frost. 
 Soil: 
 Mix 3 parts peat moss-based mix to 1 part sand for faster drainage 
 Fertilizer: 
 Most indoor plants like a steady diet of liquid plant food, but  
 not 
 palms. Palms are 
 slow-growing, especially indoors, and don't need much fertilizer. Feed with a slow-release fertilizer, such as 
 Jobe's Indoor Palm Fertilizer food spikes 
 once in spring and again in summer. It contains the micronutrients that palms need to keep them healthy, lush and green. 
 Propagation: 
  Christmas Palm seeds can take months to germinate, so be patient. 
 Sow seeds in spring or summer, covering them lightly with soil. Keep warm (75-80°F/24-27°C) and moist.

 Clubmoss - A Spreading Terrarium Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Selaginella kraussiana  
 and other spp. 
  
  
  
 I'll just say it up front. Clubmoss requires high humidity, so unless you live in the tropics, you'll want to 
 boost the humidity around this plant to keep it lush and green.

 Its mounding habit is made up of creeping stems that 
 spread quickly across the soil, forming a dense mat of foliage. 
  
 Selaginella adds a wonderful texture to any plant grouping. 
 Its unusual, branching foliage gives it another common name, spike moss. 
  
 Selaginella Varieties 
  
 Many types of Selaginella are available for sale. 
 Variegated and gold varieties will add beautiful contrast to your collection. 
 Golden-green  
 Selaginella kraussiana 
 'Aurea' is a popular cultivar. 'Variegata' has creamy white tips, giving it the common name, frosty fern. 
  
  
  
 Clubmoss Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Brown, shriveled leaves 
 are the result of dry air. Put this humidity-loving plant in a  
 terrarium 
 or  
 raise the humidity 
  around it 
 to give it the moist air it craves. 
 Prune it back 
  in spring to keep this spreading plant under control. You can prune up to half of the plant, 
 if you want. It's a vigorous grower and will fill out again. Don't toss out those stem cuttings, either -- they 
 root easily for more plants. 
 Repot in spring 
 when it outgrows its pot. Clubmoss has shallow roots, so a shallow pot will do. Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil, which will lead to root rot. Want to use a decorative pot without drainage holes? Use it as a cachepot. Just slip a plain nursery pot into the cachepot. I put small rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Is Selaginella poisonous? 
  No -- it's safe around cats and dogs. 
  
 Growing Tips for Clubmoss 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  Spreads out rather than up. 
 You can keep any variety small by pruning it back. 
 Light: 
  Indirect light; no direct sunlight 
 Water: 
  Aim to keep the potting medium lightly moist at all times, but don't allow the plant to sit in water. It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent root rot. Remember to always use room-temperature water for your tropical houseplants because cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
  High -- above 50% relative humidity. Indoor air can become extremely dry during the winter months. Use a humidity monitor, rather than guess -- it's the only sure way to know whether the air is too dry for your houseplants. If the air is dry, mist the plant every morning with room-temperature water or stand the pot on a tray 
 of wet pebbles. Keep clubmoss in a terrarium to maintain humidity around it, near a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  or in a  
 Wardian case 
 . 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). Try to maintain a steady temp -- 
 Selaginella doesn't like it too cold or too hot, especially drafts. Keep this plant away from doorways and heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix with perlite or horticultural sand added for good drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Selaginella is not a heavy feeder. Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) liquid fertilizer, at half strength. 
 Propagation: 
  Take stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. Just give the stems contact with the soil and they'll 
 take root as they grow, forming a spreading mat.

 Growing Coffee Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Coffea arabica 
 Coffee plant is the source of the world's most popular breakfast beverage. Not many know, however, that 
 it makes a beautiful and easy-to-grow house plant. 
  
  
  
 This member of the Rubiaceae family is one of 90 in the  
 Coffea 
  genus. 
 Coffea arabica 
  is believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated, 
 being grown in southwest Arabia for well over 1,000 years. 
 It is an evergreen shrub 
 that has glossy, dark-green leaves with ruffled edges on willowy stems. 
  
  
 After 3 or 4 years,  
 Coffea arabica 
  produces star-shaped, sweetly scented white flowers.  
 These flowers are followed by green 
 fruits which change to red then to almost black as they ripen, a process that takes several months. Inside each 
 ripened fruit are 2 seeds (or  
 beans 
 ) that 
 when properly roasted can be ground and made into coffee. 
  
  
 Growing coffee plants indoors is easy. They are vigorous growers and are long-lived. They make attractive house plants, 
 just don't expect them to offer that morning cup of joe. It could take a few years before you see many fruits on it. 
 Coffee bean plant can reach 15 ft or more in its native tropical habitat, but stays much smaller confined to a pot. You can cut it back to control 
 its size. Pruning harshly won't hurt it at all. 
 Prune coffee plant 
 back in spring to keep it bushy and full. 
 Pruning also gives it an attractive shape. Use clean pruning shears 
 to cut the stem at a 45° angle, 1/4-inch above a leaf axil (the place where a leaf attaches to the stem). 
 Prune off top growth to keep this coffee bean plant small. 
 Repot in spring 
 , moving to a pot 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger. Use a pot with a drainage hole to avoid soggy soil. Want to use a decorative pot without a drainage hole? Use it as a cachepot. Just slip the plain nursery pot inside the cachepot. I use small rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
  
  
 Coffee Plant Buying Tip 
  
 You can buy coffee plant at some online nurseries. 
 Look for the cultivar  
 Coffea arabica 
   
 'Nana' 
  if you want a more compact plant. 
  
  
  
 Coffee Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southern Asia and Tropical Africa 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors, confined to a pot. You can prune your plant back harshly in spring to keep it at the desired size. 
 Light: 
  Keep in bright light, shaded from direct sun. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil thoroughly moist but not soggy in spring and summer, barely moist in fall and winter. Always use tepid water for watering your houseplants because cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
  Requires moist air (around 50% relative humidity or higher). Indoor air can become extremely dry indoors, especially during the winter months. Brown leaf tips are a symptom of dry air. To raise the humidity, use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  for best results. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C).  
 Coffea arabica 
  can withstand cooler temperatures in fall and winter, when growth slows down, but it's not tolerant of freezing temperatures. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based potting mix with horticultural sand added to provide good drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Sow fresh seeds in spring. Cuttings are difficult to propagate, but you'll have the 
 best chance at success by taking young stems before they have hardened.

 Growing Coleus Plant Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Coleus blumei 
 (aka  
 Solenostemon scutellarioides 
 ) 
 Coleus plant, also known as Painted Nettle, is often grown outdoors as an annual 
 because it is frost-tender. But it's easy to grow indoors if you can provide bright light. 
 Distinctive 
 leaf shapes, intricate patterns, and rich colors rival some of the showiest 
 foliage plants. 
  
  
  
  
 Pinch your plant. 
 Coleus plants can get leggy. Pinch growing tips often to encourage them to branch out and stay 
 bushy and full. Also pinch off flower spikes as soon as you notice them because they will detract from the beautiful foliage. 
 Keep it moist. 
 Coleus leaves will wilt and may fall off if the soil is too dry. You'll have a much healthier-looking 
 plant if you keep the soil moist at all times. Use a pot with drainage holes and water thoroughly. 
 Need a container? 
 Check out the stylish 
 self-watering pots 
  
 available now. It's just the thing to keep your coleus from wilting this summer. 
 Dropped leaves? 
 Low light, dry soil or cold air can cause leaves to drop. Don't worry -- this vigorous plant will replace them when it gets what it wants. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  
 Aphids 
 like to attack new growth. Treat your plant right away and isolate it to avoid contaminating your other plants. 
  
 Coleus Varieties 
  
  
 Boundless varieties of coleus are available. Foliage colors include red, maroon, brown, cream, yellow, orange and green in dramatic 
 combinations and designs. Leaf edges may be scalloped or ruffled and have a contrasting color. 
 Stunning new hybrids make choosing just one nearly impossible. Fortunately, we don't have to choose. Coleus plant is easy to find in garden centers, and a cinch to grow from seed. 
 It's also practically foolproof to propagate from a plant -- just cut off a stem and stick it in a glass of water. 
 There's no need to over-winter them. I replace my coleus plants when they get tall and leggy. This garden favorite is inexpensive. Besides, I like to try 
 new varieties each year. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Coleus Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia 
 Height: 
 Up to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light. Some direct sun is okay, except intense summer sun which will scorch the leaves. Too little light 
 dulls leaf colors and may cause leaves to drop. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist. Leaves will wilt if thirsty. 
 Avoid getting the velvety leaves wet. Hard water will cause white spots and they won't come off. 
 Always use room-temperature water when watering houseplants. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate humidity. Check out these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical house plants.  
 Don't mist coleus leaves because tap water will leave spots 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. Leaves may wilt or fall off if the plant is exposed to temperatures below 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
 Any good-quality potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow coleus seeds in spring. Take 3 in (7 cm) coleus stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. Stem tip cuttings root 
 easily in water or moist soil.

 Copper Plant - Acalypha Wilkesiana 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Acalypha wilkesiana 
  and Hybrids 
  
  
  
 Some common names for this plant are Copperleaf, Fire Dragon and Jacob's Coat. 
 Coppery red foliage is the hallmark of spectacular Copper Plant. However, there are dozens of cultivars to choose.

 Acalypha Wilkesiana  
 Varieties 
  
 You'll find varieties with leaves streaked, splashed and edged with pink, red, bronze, purple and green, each one 
 prettier than the other. 
 'Mooreana' 
 has deeply veined maroon leaves with serrated edges. 
 'Marginata' 
 features bronze leaves edged with red and 
 'Can Can' 
 is a popular variety splashed with dark pink and creamy white. 
 Those vibrant leaves can grow up to 5 in (13 cm) long, often with sawtoothed edges. 
  
 Year-Round Care for Acalypha Wilkesiana 
  
 Cut it back. 
  
 Acalypha wilkesiana 
 is a vigorous grower. You'll have a big shrub before you know it, so it's a good idea to 
 prune it back by half every spring. 
 You'll get more 
 beautiful foliage this way -- p 
 runing encourages a flush of new stems and leaves. 
 Do not 
  pinch off growing tips, though; this plant branches out naturally. 
 Repot in spring. 
  Move the plant up one pot size when its roots fill the pot. If you see roots growing through the drainage holes, it's definitely time to repot. 
 Watch for pests. 
  Check for  
 mealy bugs 
  
 and  
 spider mites 
 . If you see any signs of pests, 
 isolate your plant and treat any infestation immediately. Raising the humidity in winter will help to prevent an invasion of spider mites that are attracted to dry conditions. The most efficient way to raise humidity for houseplants is to use a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Keep it warm in winter. 
  Copperleaf plant is an evergreen perennial that likes warmth and sunlight year-round. This tropical native will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C in winter, but prefers warm temperatures like we do. Growth is slower, so water sparingly in winter and stop fertilizing till spring.

 Acalypha Wilkesiana 
 Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Java and New Guinea 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) if not cut back 
 Light: 
  Bright light is essential for good leaf color. 
 Put your plant where it'll get plenty of light, but 
 protect plant from hot midday sun, which may cause brown scorch marks on leaves.  
 Filtered light 
 from a south- or west-facing window will give it the light it needs. 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil evenly moist year-round, but take care not to overwater. Soggy soil will 
 cause 
 Acalypha wilkesiana 
 to 
  wilt, and may lead to root rot. It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole; water thoroughly, then empty drainage tray. Water less in winter, but don't allow Copperleaf plant to dry out or leaves may fall off. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high (above 50% relative humidity). If the air is dry, especially in winter, use a  
 cool-mist humidifier 
  or pebble tray. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round. Copperleaf will tolerate temps as low as 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in early spring and pot them in equal parts horticultural sand and peat moss. 
 Use a  
 heat mat 
  to maintain a steady 75°F/24°C.

 Nertera Granadensis (Coral Bead Plant) 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Nertera granadensis 
 This unusual ornamental gets its common name Coral Bead Plant for the gorgeous show of color it puts on in summer and fall.  
 Growing in a thick mat of tiny, dark-green leaves on intertwining stems, its foliage is attractive on its own. However, s 
 mall, white flowers appear in summer only to be upstaged by bright, orange-red berries. You can expect the fiery berries to 
 completely cover the foliage and last for months. 
  
  
 Nertera granadensis 
 has become a novelty item in recent years. You may find small plants for sale in fall already covered with coral color berries. It likes the cool fall weather, so this may be an ideal time to pick one up. It's a perennial so you'll enjoy it for years to come.

 Because of 
 its need for cool temperatures and high humidity, 
 Nertera granadensis 
 can be difficult to please indoors. 
 Moving the container 
 outdoors in spring will give it the cool air and bright light it needs to flower and produce berries. 
 Just put the plant in a sheltered spot out of cold winds and direct sun. If it's kept too warm, 
 Nertera granadensis 
 will be a foliage 
 plant without berries. It will still be attractive. In fact, the foliage looks a lot like  
 Baby's Tears 
  
 ( 
 Soleirolia soleirolii 
 ). 
 Repot in spring only when it gets crowded, probably every couple years. Its creeping stems need contact with soil to keep growing. This is a good time to divide the plant, if you want. 
 Nertera granadensis 
 has shallow roots and is easy to divide for more plants. Because of its shallow roots, shallow pots will do. 
 Common names for 
 Nertera granadensis 
 are: Coral Bead Plant, Pincushion Plant and Coral Moss. 
 This plant is in the Rubiaceae family along with such unlikely relatives as the  
 coffee plant 
  
 and  
 gardenia 
 . 
  
  
  
 Nertera Granadensis Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  New Zealand, Eastern Australia, Southeast Asia and South America 
 Height: 
  3 in (8 cm); it spreads out rather than up 
 Light: 
 Bright light; no direct sun. Hot direct sunlight will cause the berries to shrivel. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist at all times, but not soggy. Don't allow 
 Nertera granadensis  
 to dry out. Shriveled leaves indicate the plant is thirsty. To prevent getting the leaves wet, try to water the soil and not the plant. Or water from the bottom -- use a pot with drainage holes and set the pot in a saucer of water; it will drink up water as needed. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim for 50% relative humidity or higher. Mist it daily from the time it flowers until the berries have formed. 
 You can boost humidity by putting 
 Nertera granadensis 
 on a tray with pebbles in the bottom with a little water. The pebbles keep the pot above the water so 
 the roots don't rot. 
 I do this for some of my plants and it works beautifully to add humidity to the air 
 around them. A  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  works well, too. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average (55-70°F/13-21°C) temperatures. Keep plant away from cold blasts from doors and windows and away from heat/AC vents. If you move your plant outdoors for the summer and fall, bring it back when temps drop below 55°/13°C at night. 
 Soil: 
 2 parts peat moss-based potting mix with 1 part horticultural sand or perlite for good drainage 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed once a month in spring and summer, with a water-soluble fertilizer at half strength, while the 
 berries are on the plant. If you're watering from the bottom, add fertilizer to the water tray. 
 Propagation: 
 Division; gently pull apart clumps and plant them in separate containers. Can also be grown from seed or from 
 tip cuttings in spring.

 Indoor Corn Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Dracaena fragrans 
  'Massangeana' 
  
  
  
 Corn plant care is easy, making it an ideal house plant. It's good for you too, because it naturally cleans the air. 
 This is one of the best house plants for removing indoor air toxins such as formaldehyde, ammonia, 
 xylene and toluene. 
  
 Leaves of the corn plant. Photo: © Gracel21 | Dreamstime.com 
  
 This hardy  
 Dracaena 
 is an unbranched, tree-like plant with sword-shaped arching leaves. 
 Those dark-green leaves are 2 ft (60 cm) long and 4 in (10 cm) wide, and have a broad cream-to-yellow stripe down the middle. 
 Strongly scented flowers are occasionally produced on a plant grown in its native habitat. Older plants may flower indoors, but it's rare. 
  
 Corn Plant Problems, Solutions and How-tos 
  
  
 Dropped leaves? 
 As it grows, corn plant will shed its lower leaves, leaving a bare stem with a cluster of leaves at its top. New plants may 
 drop a few leaves. This is normal. It needs time to adjust after the shock of being moved to a new home. 
 With your corn plant, care should be taken to keep it away from drafts and direct sun, which can cause 
 dry, brown scorch marks 
 the leaves. 
 This easy-care house plant will tolerate many abuses, but be careful not to over-water or over-fertilize. Droopy, 
 yellow 
 leaves 
 are a sign it's overwatered and may indicate root rot. Be sure to use a container with a drainage hole and never 
 allow the plant to stand in water. 
 Prune corn plant back if it grows too tall. If you want, you can propagate the stem tip cuttings for more plants. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
 Prune it back in spring or early summer 
 to control its growth. You can cut off the cane at any height. It will sprout a 
 new cluster of leaves from where it was cut. 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
  only when the plant's roots have filled the container. It is slow-growing and likely won't need repotted more than 
 every 3 years. This plant prefers to be slightly root-bound, so keep it in a smallish container -- a heavy container will prevent it 
 from toppling because this plant can get top-heavy. Here's  
 how to repot a houseplant 
 . 
 Brown leaf tips 
  are typically a symptom of low humidity, the soil is too dry or the plant may be getting too much direct sunlight. 
 Trim off brown leaf tips and move the plant out of direct sun. Keep soil moist, but remember not to 
 overwater. 
 Good indoor corn plant care will allow you to enjoy your plant for many years -- it's a long-lived house plant. 
  
 Corn Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Tropical East Africa 
 Height: 
  Grows slowly but can reach 6 ft (1.8 m) or more indoors. See pruning tip above to keep your corn plant to control its height. 
 Light: 
  Bright light. Will tolerate low light. Brown scorch marks on leaves are caused by hot, direct sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Spring through fall, keep the soil moist, but not soggy. In winter, allow top 2 in (5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity. Indoor air can become extremely dry in the winter, so it's a good idea to use a  
 humidity gauge 
  and a cool mist room humidifier, if needed. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C suit this tropical plant just fine. Care should be taken that it isn't 
 exposed to temperatures below 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer and pot them in moist potting mix.

 Creeping Fig or Climbing Fig 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Ficus pumila 
 Creeping fig has small, heart-shaped leaves that densely cover its long stems. Its growing habits make it a 
 versatile plant indoors. To show off its thickly leafed vines, put this trailing, climbing, creeping ficus plant in 
 a hanging basket. 
  
  
  
  
 Better yet, you can train its aerial roots to sink into a moss support,  
 trellis 
  or topiary. Tie it loosely to a 
 support with florist's wire and this climbing fig will readily take hold. 
 Want another option? Plant it as a ground cover beneath a tall house plant and allow the stems to spill over 
 the sides of the container. It makes a nice complement to Norfolk Island pine or a braided weeping fig 
 ( 
 F. benjamina 
 ). 
 Don't overwater. 
 Water thoroughly when potting mix is dry 1 inch down. Reduce water in the winter 
 when growth has slowed. Yellow leaves are a sign of over-watering. 
 Prune it back. 
  Creeping fig is fast-growing and needs some help from you to shape it or train it. Prune 
 off new stems regularly to encourage branching and to shape them as they grow. 
 Pruning up to one-third in spring will keep the plant compact. 
 Repot in spring. 
 This creeping ficus houseplant prefers to be slightly pot-bound. Repot every 3 years, 
 moving to a pot 1 size larger or keep it in the same pot and just give it fresh potting mix. 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 This creeping ficus houseplant is also known as  
 Ficus repens 
 . The variegated cultivars 
 are the most popular. 
 Ficus pumila 
  
 'Minima' 
 has tiny leaves, making this humidity-loving plant an ideal addition to a 
 terrarium. 
 White-edged  
 'Snowflake' 
 and  
 'Variegata' 
  are just a couple heavily variegated ficus cultivars. 
  
 Creeping Fig Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  China and Japan 
 Height: 
  Trailing to 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light. Will tolerate low light, but not direct sun. Dry, shriveled leaves are 
 caused by too much sun. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. Water less in winter, allowing the top of the potting medium to dry out before watering again. Yellow leaves are a sign of over-watering. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 50% relative humidity or higher. If it drops below 50% place the plant on a tray of wet pebbles or mist it daily with tepid water. Young plants can be kept in a  
 Wardian case 
  to hold in the humidity. 
 Temperature: 
  Will tolerate cool to warm temperatures (55-85°F/13-29°C). 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. Stop feeding in winter, when growth is slower because of lower light levels. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-4 inch stem tip cuttings in spring and root in perlite or fresh potting mix. Use  
 rooting hormone powder 
  to ensure the stems will quickly develop roots.

 Growing Croton Plants Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Codiaeum variegatum pictum 
  
 Croton plants stiff, leathery leaves in bold colors of yellow, pink, red, orange and green make it a beautiful and popular house plant. 
 Its varied colors give it another common name, Joseph's Coat. 
 The croton plant shown here is one of the most dramatic we've seen. Warm tropical colors and exotic patterned leaves 
 make 'Petra' a knockout in any brightly lit room. 
  
  
  
  
 I don't know of any houseplant that will give you more bang for your buck than this one. Those vibrant colors will rival just about any flower you could name. 
 Crotons are not easy to please. The keys to success are plenty of sunshine, a warm, draft-free environment, moist soil, and humid air. Dry air and soil will cause croton leaves to fall off. Give croton what it wants and you'll enjoy this tropical beauty a long time. 
  
 Croton Problems, Solutions and Special Care 
  
 Clean 'em up. 
 Keep leaves dust-free and shiny by gently wiping them with a damp cloth. Don't use leaf-shine products, mayo, or any other shine solution you may have heard about. Croton leaves are naturally slick and shiny. 
 Give them space. 
 If you bought a container that has 2 or 3 plants in it (which is fairly common), keep them 
 together for the first year or so. When the plants seem crowded, give them the space they need by separating them. 
 Divide croton plants by carefully cutting through their roots with a serrated knife, then pot each plant in its own container. 
  
  
 Too tall? Top them. 
 Croton plants are naturally bushy, so they shouldn't need pruning. If they get too big, you can cut them back in spring and propagate the 
 stem cuttings. 
 To repot...or not? 
  Repot in spring, moving to a pot only 1 size larger. You can control 
 croton plant's size by keeping it in the same container, so that its roots are confined. Get the  
 steps to repotting your houseplant 
  here. When the plant 
 reaches the size you want, top-dress annually instead. 
  
 How to Top Dress: 
  Remove the top 2-3 inches of soil and replace with fresh soil every couple years. Take care not to harm any roots that may be near the surface. 
  
  
 Why are croton leaves falling off? 
 Croton may drop a couple leaves when you bring it home -- it's adjusting to its new environment. If your plant continues to drop leaves, it's likely caused by a lack of sunlight or dry soil. See "Light" and "Water" tips below. Keep the plant out of drafts and away from heat/AC vents. Raising the humidity can help. For best results, use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  near the plant. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
   
 Mealybugs 
  are white and fuzzy, looking like specks of cotton along the leaf axils or stems.  
 Red spider mites 
  are so tiny, all you'll see is the fine webbing between leaves and stems. These sap-sucking pests may cause yellow, dry spots on leaves. Treat any infestation right away to prevent these pests from moving to your other indoor plants. 
 Are croton plants poisonous? Oh, yes. 
 A member of the Euphorbia family, this plant has poisonous sap. Don't be 
 afraid of crotons, but take some precautions. Keep croton away from children and pets and wear gloves while handling it.

 Types of Croton Varieties 
  
  
 Many cultivars are available, and their colors and shapes vary enormously. 
 'Golden Bell' 
 is a newer hybrid, featuring long, narrow leaves that are mostly green and yellow. 
 'Bravo' 
 has lobed leaves with yellow veins. 
 The most common variety is 
 'Petra' 
 splashed with vibrant colors. 
 New varieties are being introduced, including some with curved, twisted and even corkscrew leaves. Some are spotted, speckled or streaked.  
 'Gold Dust' 
  has small leaves, heavily spotted with yellow. Banana croton sports twisted, yellow-and-green leaves. 
 Arrowhead croton (shown above) has unusual leaves that add contrast to a group of plants.

 Caring for Croton Plants 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Pacific Islands, Malaysia, Northern Australia 
 Height: 
  Up to 3 ft (90 cm), depending on variety. When allowed to grow tall, crotons have a tree-like form with thick trunks. 
 Light: 
  Bright light and at least 3 hours of direct sun each day. 
 Leaf color is most vibrant when the plant is getting lots of light. 
 If new leaves are mostly green, move the plant to a brighter location. A lack of sunlight can cause croton to drop its leaves. Don't test it on this -- I had one that dropped all of its leaves when I left it in a less-than-sunny location. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil mix evenly moist with tepid water. It's a good idea to use a pot with drainage holes. Water thoroughly, then empty the drainage saucer. Water less in winter, when growth is slower, but don't allow the potting mix to dry out. 
 Humidity: 
  Aim to maintain relative humidity around 60% or higher around plant. Stand pot on a tray of wet pebbles or use a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperature (65-85°F/18-29°C) year-round. Don't expose this tropical native to temperatures below 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks from early spring through summer with a balanced liquid or water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem cuttings in spring and dip in rooting hormone before inserting in a half-half mix of sand 
 and peat moss-based potting mix. Croton cuttings root in about a month.

 Madagascar Dragon Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Dracaena marginata 
 Madagascar dragon tree is a bold accent if you have the space. Its daring, upright form punctuates the decor 
 like an exclamation point, adding excitement to any room. 
  
  
  
  
 This beautiful tree starts out as a thick tuft of spiky leaves. As it grows, the lower leaves naturally fall, leaving a cluster 
 of dramatic, spear-shaped leaves above a bare woody stem. Its narrow, red-edged leaves can grow about 
 12-16 in (30-40 cm) long. 
 Dracaena 
 care is easy. Dragon tree thrives in average room conditions, tolerating dry indoor air and low light levels that 
 are deadly to most plants. This dynamic house plant also handles changing temperatures and humidity levels. Just don't overwater. 
 It will not tolerate soggy soil, which can cause root rot. 
  
 Caring for Dragon Tree Year-Round 
  
 Clean it up. 
 Those tall, upright leaves tend to be dust-catchers. 
 If possible, take the plant outdoors when the weather permits and 
 gently spray the leaves with tepid water. Or wipe them off with a damp cloth. 
 Keep it short. 
 Slow-growing, this exotic house plant will eventually reach 6 ft (1.8 m) tall 
 indoors. You can control its height by simply cutting off the top. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Prune it back in spring or early summer 
 to control its growth. You can cut off the cane at any height. Within weeks, it will sprout a 
 new cluster of leaves from where it was cut. Use clean, sharp pruners to avoid tearing or infecting the stem. 
  
  
 Take a stand. 
 Give a young plant a boost by placing it on an 
 indoor plant stand 
 . 
 The tall, spiky leaves of the dragon tree looks spectacular by itself on a pedestal stand. Or combine it with shrubby and trailing plants 
 for contrast. Take a look at these new ways to display your indoor plants. 
 Repot in spring 
  when roots become coiled in the container or grow out of the drainage holes. Always use fresh potting mix 
 when you repot a plant; old potting mixes become compact over time and nutrients become depleted. Take care not to bury the stems -- keep the plant at the same soil level as before to prevent stem rot. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent root rot. 
 Something bugging your tree? 
  Dragon tree typically shrugs off pests, although dry air may attract  
 spider mites 
  
 to its leaves. Faded, yellowing leaves and webbing between leaves indicate an infestation. Regular misting with water will do double-duty, raising the humidity and keeping those pests away.  
 Scale insects 
  are small, brown discs that may be found on the underside of leaves. You can pick them off or treat your tree with an insecticide. 
  
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 This popular  
 Dracaena 
  house plant is easy to find. A few varieties are available. 
 The cultivar  
 'Tricolor' 
  has green-and-cream stripes on its leaves with red margins and also goes by the name 
 Rainbow Plant.  
 'Colorama' 
  has similar coloring as 'Tricolor' with prominent red margins. 
  
  
  
 Dragon Tree Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors; this tree is slow-growing and will take a while to reach this height. 
 Light: 
  Bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight in summer, which may cause dry, brown patches on leaves. Give your Dragon Tree a quarter turn every week to expose all sides to light for even growth. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall, slightly drier in winter. Do not let soil get waterlogged, which can cause root rot. Drooping, yellow leaves are a sign of root rot. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy potting soil. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Will tolerate dry air. 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). This tropical native doesn't like cold air, which can cause its leaves to fall off. Keep your tree away from heat/AC vents as well as blasts from windows and doorways in the winter. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced (10-10-10) liquid fertilizer diluted by half. Don't forget to feed your tree -- pale leaves are sometimes caused by too little fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Cut sections of the cane into 4-6-inch (10-15 cm) pieces and root them like stem cuttings. For best results, dip cut ends in  
 rooting hormone powder 
  before setting them in potting medium. Use a sterile medium, such as seed starting mix, or a half-and-half mix of peat moss-based mix and horticultural sand. Keep potting medium lightly moist and warm for roots to develop.

 Dumb Cane 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Dieffenbachia 
  hybrids 
 Dumb Cane get its name from its poisonous sap that causes painful swelling of the mouth and throat, as well as vocal loss 
 if eaten. Keep it away from pets who may play with or chew on this plant. It also can cause skin irritation, so I recommend wearing gloves while handling this plant. 
 This attractive and popular house plant features a single, thick trunk that unwinds into several trunks as it matures. 
 Its handsome, broad leaves are about 10 inches (25 cm) long and are splashed, streaked or speckled in green and white. 
  
  
  
  
 Dieffenbachia Varieties 
  
 Many varieties of Dumb Cane are available with varied leaf patterns. Choose one based on your own preference because they're all easy to grow. 
 You'll find Dieffenbachia for sale in nurseries or online year-round. 
 'Tropic Snow' 
 is heavily marbled with creamy white and has green 
 central veins. 
 'Camille' 
 is compact reaching only 15 in (38 cm) tall and has green-yellow leaves edged in dark green with 
 white central veins. 
 'Exotica' 
 has leaves patterned with dark green and creamy yellow blotches with white central veins. 
  
 Any problems with Dumb Cane will show in its leaves. 
  
 The older leaves may turn yellow and drop off. This is normal. If  
 new leaves fall off 
 , the plant is too cold. Keep it away from doorways or windows where could be exposed to cold drafts. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  are caused by sporadic watering. Water regularly, but don't allow the soil to get soggy. 
 Curled, crispy leaf tips 
  could indicate too much fertilizer. Flush soil with clean water to wash 
 away any accumulated fertilizer. Wait a month before feeding again. 
 If they are not getting enough light,  
 leaves lose their variegation 
 . Give the plant moderate to bright light, but not direct sun. 
 Scorched leaves 
  (dry, brown spots) are caused by strong, direct sunlight. 
  
 Pruning Tip: 
  Cut back your Dieffenbachia if it grows too tall. Use sharp pruners to cut off the top of the plant, leaving a few leaves. New growth will sprout from where it was cut. 
  
  
 Repot in spring or early summer when the plant has outgrown its pot. Always use a container with drainage holes to 
 prevent soggy soil. 
 Although this plant is native to the South American rain forests, it tolerates average room humidity quite well and is easy to grow. 
  
 Dumb Cane Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  1-6 ft (30 cm - 1.8 m) Newer hybrids are more compact reaching only 1-2 ft (30-60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, no direct sun. Give plant a quarter turn every few days to expose all sides to sunlight and encourage even growth. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly and allow soil to dry out a bit between waterings. 
 Drooping leaves on Dumb Cane indicates it's too dry. 
 Water regularly with room-temperature water and use a pot with drainage holes so its roots 
 are not sitting in water. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40% relative humidity or higher. Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter. Take a look at these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C year-round. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix with added perlite to allow good drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed spring through summer every 2 weeks with a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. In fall and winter, feed monthly. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-5 inch (8-13 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and insert in moist potting mix. Pups that 
 emerge from the base of the plant can be cut away and planted in their own containers.

 Elephant's Ear 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Alocasia x amazonica 
 Elephant's Ear is an exotic house plant with striking foliage. 
 Thick, upright stems carry arrow-shaped leaves with scalloped edges. Bold silver-green veins make a dramatic pattern 
 on glossy, dark-green leaves. 
 Alocasias grow from rhizomes, which can be divided in spring for more plants. Each rhizome produces several leaves that 
 grow to 1 ft (30) long, making Elephant's Ear a sassy, new accent for your home. Put it on a 
 pedestal stand 
 to show it off. 
 Just like other members of the Araceae family, its flowers are composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. On this plant, however, they are insignificant. It's the spectacular foliage that makes this tropical native well worth growing. 
  
  
  
 Few indoor plants are as eye-catching as this one. Even young alocasias stand out, but will soon reach 2 ft (60 cm) tall or more. 
 Set alocasia in a bright location and keep it warm all year. With good care, you'll enjoy this exotic house plant a long time. 
  
 Caring for Elephant's Ear 
  
  
 This tropical house plant can be somewhat fussy, preferring the high humidity of a greenhouse to an average home. However, a 
 room humidifier and frequent misting of the leaves will give it the moist air it craves. Regular misting also helps 
 to keep away  
 red spider mites 
  that are attracted to 
 dry conditions. 
 Repot in spring when necessary. Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. 
 Give your plant a rest period in winter, allowing the soil to become almost dry between waterings and stop fertilizing. 
 It may go dormant if it dries out completely. But don't give up on it -- it'll recuperate in a month or two with good care. 
 Continue to provide plenty of humidity with a pebble tray or a cool-mist humidifier. 
 You'll find Alocasia for sale in garden centers and online nurseries in spring and summer. This tropical beauty also goes by common names African Mask and Polly Plant. 
 A. x amazonica 
  'Polly' is a popular cultivar that stays compact. 
  
 Elephant's Ear Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Tropical Asia 
 Height: 
 To 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, but no direct sun. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil moist spring through fall when plant is actively growing. Water sparingly in winter, allowing soil to 
 become almost dry between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
  Requires moist air, preferably 50% relative humidity or higher. Use a cool-mist room humidifier near the plant for best results. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm 65-75°F/18-24°C. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. Do not feed in winter. 
 Propagation: 
 Division. Divide rhizomes in spring and pot in separate containers. Keep the top surface 
 of the rhizome above the soil line so that the growing stems don't rot at soil level.

 English Ivy Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Hedera helix 
  
  
  
  
 With lobed leaves and lush, trailing vines, English Ivy is an elegant accent plant. Small-leafed ivies blend beautifully in a dish garden, adding texture to a 
 variety of tropical plants. 
 Although commonly grown as a hanging plant indoors, its aerial roots can easily 
 be trained to climb a moss stick or trellis. Or if you're feeling really adventurous, train ivy on a topiary. 
 English ivy is a vigorous grower when it gets the light and moisture it wants. You'll want to  
 repot 
  in spring 
  every couple years to give it a slightly larger pot to grow in to and to freshen the soil. Don't jump from a small container to a much larger one (no matter how beautiful it is) because it will hold too much water, which can lead to root rot. 
  
  
 Varieties of English Ivy 
  
 There are hundreds of types of ivy varieties -- some with plain green leaves, others are variegated 
 with yellow, gold or creamy white. Many 
 named cultivars are available to choose from. 
 As their names suggest, 
 'Itsy Bitsy' 
 is a small variety. 
 'Curlilocks' 
 has wavy leaves. 
 Among those with variegated leaves are 
 'Gold Child' 
 (one of my favorites) 
 splashed with yellow-gold, white and shades of gray. 
 'Glacier' 
 ivy has silvery gray-green leaves edged in creamy white. 
  
 Common English Ivy Problems, Answers and Solutions 
  
  
 Dry, crispy leaves? 
  Cool, moist air and evenly moist soil will help your English Ivy thrive indoors. Protect it from drafts and heating vents. 
 Mist the plant often to keep its leaves from drying out. Misting also helps to keep away  
 spider mites 
  
 that love to attack this plant. 
 Prune it back 
 , if you want to keep your ivy plant to a desired length. Light pruning can be done any time of year. 
 Wilted leaves? 
  Dry soil or consistently soggy soil will each cause leaves to wilt. Over-watering is usually the problem and leads to root rot. It's best to use a container with drainage holes, water thoroughly then empty the drainage tray. Water less often in the winter months when growth is slower. 
 Faded foliage? 
 Growing ivy with plenty of bright light will help variegated ivies to keep their 
 color. Prune off any stems of variegated ivy that reverts to all green. 
 Is it poisonous? 
  Yes. English ivy leaves are poisonous if eaten and can cause skin irritation. It's a good idea to wear gloves while handling 
 this plant, and to keep it away from children, cats and dogs. 
  
 Ivies add color, texture and fresh style to any room -- mingling with large-leaf plants or on their own. 
  
 Tips for Growing English Ivy House Plants 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Europe 
 Height: 
  It will climb as high as it is allowed to. 
 Light: 
  Bright light, but no direct sun. Ivy thrives under  
 fluorescent light 
 . 
 If a variegated variety changes to mostly green, it isn't getting enough light. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist but not soggy spring through fall; slightly drier in winter when growth is slower. Wilted leaves are a symptom of dry soil; however, root rot caused by soggy soil will also cause leaves to wilt. It's a good idea to use a container with drainage holes. Water thoroughly, then empty drainage tray. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim to maintain a 40% relative humidity or higher around the plant. 
 Raise the humidity 
  by misting with water or standing English ivy on a tray of wet pebbles. Humidity can drop drastically in the winter. If your home gets too dry, use a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool to average room temperatures (50-75°F/10-24°C) year-round. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based mix with added perlite or vermiculite for good drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly from spring through fall with a high-nitrogen water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-4 in (8-10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root in moist soil or water.

 European Fan Palm Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Chamaerops humilis 
  
  
  
  
 European Fan Palm (aka Mediterranean Fan Palm) is the only palm native to 
 Europe, and is hardier than most palms. Give it the warm, sunny 
 days and cool nights of its native dry mountain habitat and you'll find that it's easy to grow. 
 This shruby palm will eventually reach about 4 ft (1.2 m) tall indoors. As 
 the plant matures, the trunk develops numerous sharp spines. 
 Fine-textured fronds grow in a rounded fan of 10-20 leaflets that reach up to 24 in/60 cm wide. The leaflets 
 range in color from silvery green to blue-green and naturally split as they mature. 
 Repot only when needed. European fan palm has fragile roots, so repot only every 3 years or so. They grow deep -- 
 so keep this palm in a deep pot. 
 Once the plant reaches the size you want, you can top-dress it instead by replacing the top couple inches 
 of potting mix. Take care not to disturb any roots that may be near the surface. 
  
 Watering tip: 
  Palms are sensitive to chlorine, fluoride, and other 
 chemicals often found in tap water, as well as the salt in softened water. Use only distilled or 
 filtered water to avoid the build-up of chemicals. 
  
  
 Although slow-growing, it is well worth the wait because even small plants will stand out, making it a 
 stunning sculptural accent for the home. This fan palm tree is also long-lived, so you'll enjoy it for many years. 
 This European palm looks similar to some other fan palms that aren't as easy to please indoors. 
 Look for the  
 Chamaerops humilis 
 botanical name to be sure you're getting this palm. 
  
 European Fan Palm Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mediterranean region of Southwestern Europe (Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Malta) 
 Height: 
 4 ft (1.2 m) tall 
 Light: 
 Needs at least 4 hours of direct sun a day. Give the pot a quarter-turn every week to expose each side to sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Keep constantly moist in spring and summer. In fall and winter, allow top 2 in (5 cm) of soil to 
 dry out between waterings. When watering, avoid getting the base of the palm wet to prevent rot. 
 Use a container with drainage holes, and fast-draining potting mix to prevent soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room humidity (around 40% relative humidity). If air is dry in winter, use a cool-mist room  
 humidifier like this one 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 70-80°F/21-27°C days; 50-60°F/10-16°C nights 
 Soil: 
  Mix 2 parts peat moss-based potting mix and 1 part sharp sand. Repot only when necessary, about 
 every 3 years. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring and summer with a palm fertilizer diluted by half. Do not 
 feed in fall and winter. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow seeds in spring, barely covering 
 the seeds with soil. Keep them warm (75-80°F/24-27°C) and moist. Palm seeds can take several weeks to germinate, so be patient. 
 European palm is one of the few palms that readily produces suckers that can be cut away and potted in their own containers.

 False Aralia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Dizygotheca elegantissima 
 False Aralia has slender leaflets that grow in a circle at the tops of stems so that they look like fingers, giving this house plant 
 another common name: Finger Aralia. 
 New coppery brown foliage turns a dark, blackish-green as the plant matures. Its narrow, serrated leaflets give this small tree 
 a 
 lacy appearance, adding elegance to a collection of tropical house plants. 
  
  
  
  
 Leaf drop. 
  
 Dizygotheca 
 likes to stay put. Moving it to a new location may cause its leaves to drop. 
 Shedding leaves may also indicate that humidity is too low. Mist the plant every morning or stand the pot on a tray 
 of wet pebbles. Misting also helps to prevent 
 spider mites 
  that may invade this plant. 
 Pruning. 
  False Aralia is slow-growing and doesn't need pruned unless you want to control its height. 
 Over time, it will drop its lower leaves, revealing a single tree-like trunk. If you want, you can 
 keep it short and shrubby by cutting it back each year. Don't be afraid to prune it to 6 inches (15 cm) from the soil level. 
 Spring is the best time to cut it back. New offsets will grow from the base of the plant. 
 Repotting. 
 Repot in spring only when it has outgrown its pot, but use the smallest container that will hold its roots. It grows best 
 when its roots are confined. Taller plants should be potted in a heavy container to prevent toppling. 
 Dizygotheca elegantissima 
  is sometimes sold as Finger Aralia or Spider Aralia. 
 It's well-worth seeking out. With good care, it's a long-lived plant and a striking accent. 
 Small plants look gorgeous in dish gardens, adding an upright palm-like form to the grouping. 
 Put one with other tropical plants that like humidity, such as heartleaf philodendron 
 or nerve plant.  
 Seedlings will thrive in a terrarium under  
 fluorescent light 
 . 
  
 False Aralia Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South Pacific 
 Height: 
 This Pacific Island native can grow to 20 ft (6 m) in the wild, but indoors this tree will slowly reach about 6 
 ft (1.8 m). 
 Light: 
 Bright light, no direct sun. 
 Too much sun exposure may cause leaf edges to turn brown. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly and allow top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. Wilted leaves are a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (around 50% relative humidity or above). Take a look at these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Keep plant warm (65-85°F/18-29°C) year-round. Do not expose it to temperatures below 60°F/16°C, which can cause leaf drop. 
 Soil: 
 All-purpose house plant potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer (such as 10-10-10 NPK) diluted by half. In fall and winter, feed 
 monthly. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds or stem tip cuttings. Take stem tip cuttings in spring. For best results, dip cut end in 
 hormone rooting powder 
 before inserting 
 in moist potting mix. Cover with a plastic bag to raise the humidity around the cutting. Keep it warm and out of 
 direct sunlight.

 Fiber Optic Grass 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Isolepis cernua 
  aka  
 Scirpus cernuus 
  
  
  
 Fiber Optic Grass is a fountain-like ornamental grass-like sedge with small, silvery white 
 flowers at the tips. Its resemblance to fiber optic wire lends its common names, including Live Wire Grass. 
 If you like unusual indoor plants, you'll want to add this ornamental sedge to your collection. It's a fun plant to have around.

 Growing in a clumping mound, 
 Isolepis cernua 
 spills over the sides of a container as it grows, making it ideal for a tall 
 planter or even a hanging pot. Eye-catching on its own, this decorative grass-like sedge also adds texture among 
 a display of foliage and flowering plants. 
 You'll find fiber optic grass 
 for sale in garden centers and online nurseries in spring and summer. 
 Plants are inexpensive, and you can also buy seeds. Sowing seeds is easy (see Propagation below). 
 Is Fiber Optic Grass poisonous? 
  Yes, both the plant and seeds are toxic if eaten. Keep it away from children and 
 pets if there is any chance they may play with or ingest them. 
 Isolepis cernua 
 can also cause skin irritation so you may want to wear gloves when handling it. 
  
 Water generously. 
 Don't allow the soil to dry out. Foliage will turn yellow then brown when it 
 gets too dry. Water thoroughly and often to keep the soil  
 at least 
  evenly moist at all times. 
 Fiber Optic Grass is native to marsh areas, so it doesn't mind soggy soil. 
 Repot in spring 
 , moving up to a container 1 size larger every 2-3 years, or when it becomes crowded. 
 Spring is also a good time to divide the plant, if you want. 
 Perennial and evergreen, this showy sedge is an easy-care house plant. Keep it warm and moist, give it sunlight, and you can expect blooms from spring through fall. 
  
 Fiber Optic Grass Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southern Europe and Northern Africa 
 Height: 
  Up to 1 ft (30 cm)  
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil moist or wet at all times. 
 Constantly moist soil is needed to keep  
 I. cernua 
  healthy and thriving. 
 Native to marshlands, this is one 
 plant you can't overwater. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate room (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. 
 If you put this tender ornamental out on the patio for the summer, it can take the heat, but bring it back indoors 
 when the temperature drops. It won't tolerate frost. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble 
 fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow seed in spring, barely covering the seeds. Keep the soil warm (around 70°F/21°C) 
 and constantly moist. Mature plants can be divided and potted separately.

 Ficus Alii 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Ficus binnendiijkii 
  'Alii' 
 Ficus Alii doesn't exist in the wild. 'Alii' is a fairly new cultivar and makes 
 a handsome indoor tree. 
  
  
  
 The long, narrow leaves are naturally glossy and taper to a point. As this ficus tree grows, it may drop its lower 
 leaves revealing a bare woody trunk, giving this tree a palm-like appearance. Sometimes its trunks are braided by 
 growers making it look like a topiary. It makes a bold statement in any brightly lit room. 
 Care is easier than for many of its relatives. You'll find it's less temperamental than  
 F. benjamina 
 , that 
 drops its leaves when it doesn't get what it wants. However, leaf drop is possible with 'Alii' if it doesn't 
 get enough light and regular waterings. 
 Repot only when necessary in spring, using the smallest pot that will contain its roots. Ficus plants are 
 slow-growing and prefer to be slightly pot-bound. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Ficus Alii seems resistant to pests. However, watch for  
 whiteflies 
 and  
 scale insects 
  that tend to bother ficus plants. 
 Treat any infestation immediately. 
 You'll find alii ficus plants for sale in garden centers or online nurseries in spring and summer. Although this 
 exciting hybrid has only been available for a few years, they're becoming popular because of 
 their adaptability to growing indoors. 
 And good for you, too. 
 Ficus are among the best for improving air quality indoors. They're triumphant in removing toxins 
 such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from tainted indoor air. 
  
 Ficus Alii Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrid 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) indoors. Pruning ficus will control its size. 
 Light: 
 Give  
 Ficus binnendiijkii 
 bright light year-round. 
 It's not as fussy about being moved around as other ficus house plants, 
 but it may drop leaves if suddenly moved into a shady corner or full sun. 
 Water: 
  Water soil thoroughly, then allow top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings. Use lukewarm 
 water because cold water may cause leaf loss. Avoid using softened water -- it contains salts which can harm ficus plants. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room humidity (around 40-50% relative humidity). Take a look at these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every other month spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Stem tip cuttings and air layering. Propagating ficus trees is not easy for the 
 amateur to do at home. These trees are slow to root from either method.

 Fiddle Leaf Fig 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Ficus lyrata 
 Enormous leaves shaped like violins make Fiddle Leaf Fig a dramatic accent. 
 In its native habitat, this fig tree from the Moraceae family will reach 40 ft (12 m) tall. Fortunately, it grows 
 very slowly and stays much shorter when grown indoors. 
 A few dwarf fig tree cultivars are available, including 
 'Bambino' 
 and 
 'Little Fiddle'. 
 Controlling its height is easy to do. Prune off the top of young plants to promote branching and to control its 
 growth. You can also control its size by keeping it in a small container. 
 You don't have to cut it back, though. The broad leaves of this fig tree make it a beautiful, live structural 
 accent in a room with high ceilings. 
  
  
  
  
 Its bold, prominently veined leaves grow to 12 in (30 cm) long and 6 in (15 cm) wide with wavy edges. Keep the naturally glossy 
 leaves clean by wiping them often with a damp cloth. This tropical native also loves to be misted. 
  
 Fiddle Leaf Fig Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Wondering when to repot? 
  Repot only when necessary (e.g., its roots are growing out of the drainage holes or coiled in the bottom of the pot) in spring, using the smallest pot that will contain its roots. Use a heavy container to 
 keep it from toppling over; this tree can get top-heavy. 
 Brown leaf tips 
 are sometimes caused by dry soil. Use a container with a drainage hole and water the 
 plant thoroughly until water drains out the bottom. This is the only way to be sure that all the roots are watered. 
  
 Dropped Leaves? 
  
 If you just brought your plant home from the nursery and it dropped some of its leaves, don't worry. It's just adjusting to its new home. With good care, it'll grow new leaves. 
  
  
 Leaf drop 
 is fairly common with ficus plants, especially when they're moved to a new environment. Changes 
 in light levels and temperature can cause leaves to drop, so it's a good idea to put your plant in a bright spot, out of direct sunlight 
 and leave it there. Also keep it away from heat/AC vents or drafts from entryways. It may take a few weeks for your 
 plant to adjust to a new place, so don't give up on it. 
 While it may be tempting to repot, overwater or fertilize a shedding fig tree, 
 don't do it 
 . It'll only cause more 
 stress to the tree and make the problem worse. 
 Something bugging your fig? 
  A couple pests may invade figs trees. 
 Scale 
 are 
 small brown insects that cling to stems and leaves, sucking sap and secreting a sticky residue on the plant. Also watch for webbing between 
 branches and leaves, they're a tell-tale sign of a 
 spider mite 
  
 invasion. Treat any infestation immediately. 
 Is Fiddle Leaf Fig poisonous? 
  Yes.  
 Ficus lyrat 
 a is toxic to people, cats and dogs. It should not be eaten and its sap may cause skin irritation. It's a good idea to wear gloves when pruning and repotting this plant. 
 Although a bit fussy, fig plants make long-lived and beautiful indoor trees. Give your plant what it wants and you'll 
 enjoy your Fiddle Leaf Fig for many years. 
  
  
  
 Fiddle Leaf Fig Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Western Africa 
 Height: 
 3-10 ft (90 cm - 3 m) indoors 
 Light: 
 Give  
 Ficus lyrata 
  right indirect light year-round. Give your fiddle leaf fig a quarter turn every week or so to 
 expose all sides to light. 
 Like other ficus house plants, its leaves will drop if suddenly 
 moved into low light. 
 Water: 
 Use a planter with drainage holes to avoid soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. Water thoroughly, then allow potting mix to dry out a bit before watering again. Drooping yellow leaves are a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40-50% relative humidity). If indoor air is dry, the best way to increase humidity for your tropical houseplants is to use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality all-purpose potting mix with added perlite for faster drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed 3 times a year during the growing season (spring-summer-fall) with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Stem tip cuttings and air layering. Propagating large-leaf fig trees is not easy for the 
 amateur to do at home. These trees are slow to root from either method.

 Fishtail Palm Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Caryota mitis 
 Fishtail palm tree gets its common name from the ragged-edged, ribbed texture of the dark-green 
 leaflets that grow on upright stems. Its triangular leaflets are unique, and over time naturally split 
 at the ends -- just like a fish tail.

 Caryota mitis 
  grows in a clump, with several stems rising from its base that can easily be divided. 
 Native to Southeast Asia, Fishtail Palm thrives in warm temperatures and humidity. Despite its tropical beginnings, this palm is 
 one of the easiest indoor palm plants to grow, requiring little care. 
  
 Grown as an indoor palm tree, it can reach several feet tall indoors, therefore it needs some vertical space. T 
 his palm becomes more 
 lush and attractive as it matures; however, even 
 small plants are attention-getting in any brightly lit room. 
  
 Fishtail Palm Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 To repot...or not? 
  Repot only when roots grow out of the bottom of the drainage hole. Move it to a pot only 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger than the old one; this palm prefers to be slightly pot-bound. Crowded roots helps to limit this palm's size so it won't grow too large to keep indoors. 
 Use a container with a drainage hole to prevent soggy potting medium, one thing this palm won't tolerate. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  are likely caused by dry soil or more likely, dry air. Use any practical means to increase 
 the humidity around this palm. A room humidifier works best. 
  
 Wondering whether to prune? 
 Do not prune palm trees unless an old branch dies. Palm trees grow from the tip of the branch. 
 If you prune or pinch off the newest frond where it is attached to the stem, it will stop all new growth. 
 Dark brown or black spots 
  on leaves are caused by a leafspot fungus. Cut off affected leaves. Place your palm where it'll get plenty of bright light and air circulation to prevent fungal diseases. 
  
 Fishtail Palm Tree Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Burma, Malaysia 
 Height: 
  Around 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors 
 Light: 
   
 Give your palm bright, indirect sunlight during the growing season. 
 You can move it outdoors for the summer, just keep it out of direct sun. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly then allow soil to dry slightly between waterings. 
 It is more tolerant of drier soil than wet. 
  
 Water less in winter when growth has slowed. 
 Use filtered or distilled water because tap water may contain fluoride, chlorine and other chemicals that can damage palms. 
 Humidity: 
  Give this tropical native the humidity it craves. It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge near your palm, rather than guess. Indoor air can become extremely dry, especially during the winter months. If relative humidity drops below 50%, stand the pot on a humidity tray or 
 use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm temperatures, preferably 65°F/18°C at night and up to 85°F/29°C during the day. Palms don't like the cold. Protect your plant from cold drafts near doorways and AC vents. 
 Soil: 
  All-purpose, good-quality potting mix. 
 Add a little sand to the potting soil to speed up drainage. Use a ratio of 3:1 potting mix 
 to sand. Use horticultural sand, not the type from the beach, which contains salts and impurities 
 that can damage palms. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once in early summer with slow-release fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Sow seeds in 
 spring or summer in fresh potting medium. Don't bury them -- palm seeds germinate best when they are barely covered. Keep them warm and moist. Use a seedling heat mat, if needed to maintain a minimum 70°F/21°C while seedlings sprout. Offsets can be carefully cut away from the plant and potted in separate containers.

 Care of Foxtail Fern 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Asparagus densiflorus 
  'Myers' 
 Upright, emerald plumes make foxtail fern a gorgeous accent plant for 
 container groupings or staging among tropicals.

 This beautiful house plant is easy to grow and some say more decorative than its close relative, the 
 asparagus fern 
 . 
 Foxtail fern is not a true fern, but a member of the lily family. Although there is no family resemblance, it's also related to 
 the edible asparagus vegetable. 
 Stems are densely covered with 1 in (2.5 cm) needle-like leaflets give this plant a delicate, feathery 
 appearance. But don't let its fragile appearance fool you. In its native, warm temperature forests of 
 Africa, foxtail fern is an aggressive grower and can be invasive. That's not a problem, though, contained 
 in a pot. Cut the stems back or divide the plant in spring to keep it under control. 
  
 Growing Foxtail Fern Year-Round 
  
 Prune it back. 
  Cut back stems to keep this fern compact and bushy. Trim off old, faded fronds 
 to make room for new growth and to keep the plant looking its best. 
 Repot in spring. 
  Move to a pot only 
 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) 
  
 larger. Allow at least 1 in (2.5 cm) space from the rim of the pot, 
 because the fleshy, tuberous roots sometimes force the potting mix up as they grow. 
 Leaf drop 
  is usually a symptom of too little or too much sunlight -- or, more likely -- dry soil. Foxtail 
 likes dappled sunlight. Water regularly, but take care not to overwater. The plant's thick, tuberous roots 
 store water and soggy soil can cause root rot. Raising the humidity can help; this plant loves to be misted. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Dry conditions in winter may draw  
 spider mites 
  to houseplants. They're so tiny, they are hardly noticeable. You'll recognize them by the fine webbing among the foliage. Raising the humidity around your tropical plants will help to prevent them. Treat any infestation immediately because spider mites multiply quickly, then will move on to your other houseplants.

 Foxtail Fern Care Tips 
  
 Feathery plumes make Foxtail a beauty. 
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 Up to 3 ft (90 cm) long 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect sunlight year-round. For even growth, give the plant a quarter turn every week or so to expose all sides to sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, allowing soil to dry out a little between waterings. Too much water can lead to root rot. 
 Water sparingly in winter, but do not allow soil to dry out completely, which can cause foxtail fern to shed its leaflets. Remember to use tepid water to water your house plants. 
 Humidity: 
 Prefers moist air. Aim to maintain 40-50% relative humidity. Set pot on a tray of wet pebbles and mist leaves with room- 
 temperature water. Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter; use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  near your plant, if needed. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. Foxtail fern will tolerate a minimum of 50°F/10°C. Keep this plant away from heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 All-purpose, good-quality potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble houseplant fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Division. Divide overcrowded plants in spring. Remove the plant from its pot and 
 cut through the thick roots with a sharp knife to avoid pulling and tearing them. Try to keep as much of the roots intact as possible.

 Friendship Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pilea involucrata 
  'Moon Valley' 
  
  
  
 Friendship Plant has quilted leaves of apple green with deep bronze veins that make it a joy to grow indoors. 
 Pilea 
 is a genus of 100s of species, and this is one of the few grown as an indoor plant. 
 One of the most popular cultivars is 'Moon Valley', shown here. 
 It's sometimes sold as 
 Pilea mollis. 
  
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 Pilea likes moist soil, warm temperatures and high humidity. Give this tropical plant what it wants and it'll reward you with beautiful foliage. Be sure to root those cuttings and you'll enjoy Friendship Plant for a long time. 
  
  
 'Moon Valley' has a more upright habit than the species, which is a trailing plant. Its toothed, deeply textured leaves feature dark-red undersides. Clusters of tiny, pink-green flowers may appear in spring, but they are insignificant compared to the showy foliage. 
 This is a bushy, fast-growing plant with ovate leaves that grow in opposite pairs. Pinch off growing tips, if 
 you want, to keep the plant compact. Those cuttings will root easily, so don't toss them out. Share them with 
 friends or pot them up for more plants. 
 Dropped leaves can be caused by either dry or soggy soil. However, you can expect the lower leaves to 
 fall off as plants get older, making them look leggy and unattractive. That's another good reason to 
 propagate stem cuttings for more plants -- you may want to replace your plant after a few years. 
  
  
 Friendship Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Central and South America 
 Height: 
 Up to 12 in (30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Moderate to bright light. 
 Place your plant near a window, but away from direct sunlight, which can scorch its leaves. Give  
 Pilea involucrata 
  a quarter turn every few days to expose all sides to sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Use a pot with drainage holes and water thoroughly. Allow water to drain, then empty drainage tray. Allow the potting medium to dry out a bit between waterings; Friendship Plant won't tolerate soggy soil and may get root rot. Keep it slightly drier in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Humidity: 
 High humidity is a must. If relative humidity drops below 50%, place pot on a tray of 
 wet pebbles or use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . It makes an excellent terrarium plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) suit this tropical plant. K 
 eep 
 it away from heat/AC vents or drafts from doors and windows. It will tolerate a low of 55°F/13°C in winter. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based mix or African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced 
 (such as 10-10-10) 
 water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by 
 half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem tip cuttings in spring. Put the stem in moist potting mix, then firm the mix around the 
 stem so that it stands up. Enclose the whole pot in a plastic bag to hold in humidity. Cuttings root easily in about a month.

 Gold Dust Plant - Aucuba japonica 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Aucuba japonica 
  'Variegata' 
 Green leaves heavily dusted with golden-yellow spots makes Gold Dust Plant a cheery house plant, and a 
 beautiful accent among other foliage plants. 
  
  
  
  
 You'll have easy success with this compact, upright shrub because it adapts well to indoor conditions. 
 In fact, it doesn't need much attention to thrive. It grows well in a pot. Just shade it from direct sunlight, 
 keep it cool and well-watered. Prune it back each spring to keep it small. 
 Aucuba japonica 
 varieties include both male and female plants that produce clusters of 
 tiny purplish flowers in spring. They're not very attractive, but if pollinated, the flowers are followed by 
 bright red berries carried on the plant through the winter. 
 Aucuba japonica 
  is known by a few common names: Gold Dust Plant, Japanese Laurel, Spotted Laurel and Japanese Aucuba. 
 A few cultivars are available... 'Crotonifolia' has broad leaves spotted with yellow. 
 'Serratifolia' (shown below) has mottled yellow saw-tooth leaves. 'Picturata' is broadly splashed with yellow-gold across its leaves. 
  
 Care Tips for Aucuba Japonica 
  
  
 Prune in spring 
 . Although slow-growing, Gold Dust Plants will get tall and leggy over time. Prune the stems 
 back hard in spring to keep  
 Aucuba japonica 
  a manageable size indoors and to encourage branching. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Cut stems at a 45° angle, just after a node 
 (the place where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem). Use sharp pruners to 
 avoid tearing the stems. 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
 , moving up to a container 1 size larger every 2-3 years, or when needed. If your Japanese aucuba is already 
 big, you can top-dress instead by removing the top 2-3 (5-7.5 cm) inches of soil and replace it with fresh potting soil. 
 Clean those beautiful spotted leaves 
 to keep them dust-free. Wipe them off with a damp cloth. 
  
 Aucuba Japonica Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Cultivar with parents native to Japan and China 
 Height: 
 Up to 3 ft (90 cm) indoors. Prune to keep the shrub small. 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light. Some cool, direct morning sunlight is fine. 
 Bright, filtered sunlight will help Gold Dust Plant keep its variegation. Don't move it 
 outdoors unless you have a cool, shady spot for it. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist from spring through fall. Then, cut back on watering in winter 
 when growth has slowed. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room -- around 40% relative humidity or higher. Because levels can drop drastically in winter, it's a good idea to use a  
 pebble tray or cool-mist humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Cool (45-65°F/7-18°C) temperatures year-round suit this Japanese laurel just fine. 
 In fact, it can tolerate cold -- down to 5°F/-15°C -- and is sometimes grown as an outdoor shrub. 
 Soil: 
 All-purpose houseplant potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a water-soluble  
 fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow seed in spring. Or take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer and 
 root in moist potting mix.

 Grape Ivy Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Cissus rhombifolia 
 Grape Ivy is a vigorous, evergreen vine with handsome, glossy compound leaves, each bearing 3 leaflets. Young leaves are fuzzy, giving 
 them a silvery sheen. It's extremely adaptable to indoor conditions and makes an easy house plant. 
 Pot this vine in a hanging basket to show off its beautiful trailing foliage. Large plants can be trained up a trellis or moss pole. Its sturdy vines will scramble up any support, climbing and clinging with its curling tendrils. 
  
  
  
  
 Pinch and prune 
 . Growing tips are tender and can be pinched off with your fingernails. Regular pinching will 
 keep your grape ivy plant compact and bushy.  
 Don't toss out those stem tips 
 either. You can propagate them 
 for more plants. 
 Control the plant's size by pruning every spring. Use sharp pruners and always cut at a 45° angle after a leaf node 
 (the place where a leaf attaches to the stem). If a lower stem becomes bare, don't be afraid to cut it 
 back at the soil level; this vigorous grower will quickly grow new stems. 
 Repot in spring 
 every couple years or when roots fill the pot. Use one with drainage holes to prevent 
 soggy soil and root rot. Want to use a planter without holes? Just slip a plain nursery pot into a  
 cachepot 
  (a decorative plant pot without drainage). I put small rocks in the bottom of my cachepots to keep the nursery pot above the drainage water. 
 Give it a rest in winter 
 . Grape ivy doesn't go dormant in the winter, but growth slows down with fewer hours of daylight. One of the common problems with  
 plant care is overwatering. Allow soil to dry out a bit between waterings in winter and stop 
 fertilizing until spring. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
   
 Aphids 
  are small green or black insects that are attracted to new growth on this soft-stemmed plant. Rinse them off by spraying with water.  
 Grape ivy is sensitive to pesticides and some types of insecticidal soap or oil 
 ; it's a good idea to test any insect spray on one leaf first.  
 Red spider mites 
  are so tiny, you'll likely only notice the fine webbing between stems. Isolate your plant and cut off any infested leaves and stems. Use a soft cloth to gently clean the undersides of remaining leaves. If your plant is badly infested,  
 get rid of it 
  -- you don't want those destructive critters to destroy your other house plants. Spider mites are attracted to dry conditions, so mist Grape Ivy often with a fine spray of water to raise the humidity.

 C. antarctica 
 ) is an Australian native with single pointed, toothed leaves. 
  
 Grape Ivy Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
 Size varies with variety. Some plants will climb up to 6 ft (1.8 m) or more with support. 
 You can keep it to 2 ft (60 cm) with pruning. 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect sunlight. Protect your plant from direct sun, which can cause 
 brown scorch marks on the leaves. Grape Ivy also grows well under fluorescent light. 
 Water: 
 Water generously throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist. 
 Water less in winter, allowing the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil to dry between waterings. 
 Shriveled leaves that fall off are a sign the soil is either too wet or too dry. 
 Humidity: 
 Grape ivies like relative humidity near 40-60%. Brown leaf tips are 
 sometimes caused by dry air. Using a  
 humidity tray 
  can help, but give your ivy plant good air circulation 
 to prevent  
 powdery mildew 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Warm in spring and summer (65-80°F/18-27°C). Slightly cooler in fall 
 and winter (55-70°F/13-21°C). 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-4 in (7.5-10 cm) stem tip cuttings in late spring. Strip off the lower leaves and 
 dip cut ends in  
 rooting hormone powder 
 . Then insert cuttings in a 1:1 mixture of moist peat and perlite. 
 Enclose the pot in a plastic bag to maintain humidity. Roots should grow in 6-8 weeks.

 Heartleaf Philodendron 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Philodendron scandens 
 Heartleaf philodendron is a popular house plant because it is extremely easy to grow. It's also known as the Sweetheart Plant. 
 Heart-shaped, glossy leaves emerge bronze, then quickly turn green. The leaves are typically 2-4 in (5-10 cm) long, and 
 cover its long, slender stems that can grow to 4 ft (1.2 m) or more. 
  
  
  
  
 Pinch your plant. 
  Without pinching, it will grow with long, single stems and become lanky. You can pinch it back 
 anytime to help it branch out, keeping the plant bushy and full. Always pinch after a leaf 
 node (the place where a leaf is attached to the stem). A new stem will grow from that node. 
  
 Pinching tip: 
  Try to pinch close to the node because any bare stem that is left will die, and the node will not grow a new stem. Make a clean cut -- you want to avoid jagged tears, which can attract disease. You can use your fingernails to pinch, or use sharp scissors or pruners. 
  
  
 Or let it grow. Few house plants are as eager to climb as a heartleaf philodendron. If you allow the long stems to grow, 
 put the plant in a hanging basket, or let it trail from a shelf or bookcase. To train it to climb a moss pole, use floral tape or soft plant ties 
 to hold the stems up to the pole, until its aerial roots sink in. 
 It will thrive in a small pot for a couple years with little care. Despite its tropical origins, this beautiful evergreen 
 plant is tolerant of dry air, although it appreciates occasional misting. Keep its leaves clean by wiping them with a damp cloth. 
 Wondering whether to repot? 
 It's definitely time to repot every 2-3 years, in spring or early summer. Use a container with drainage holes to prevent root rot. If you 
 want to use a decorative container without drainage, use it as a cachepot -- just slip your plain nursery pot into 
 the cachepot. I like to cover the bottom of a cachepot with pebbles to keep the plant above the drainage water. 
  
 Problems and Solutions for Heartleaf Philodendron 
  
 Wilted leaves 
  are likely because the potting medium has dried out. Although it will tolerate dry soil, I wouldn't let it go too long without a drink. Another possibility for wilting is root rot. 
 Yellow leaves 
  are caused by prolonged soggy soil. Overwatering is the number one reason houseplants die. 
 But it's easy to avoid. Use a pot with drainage holes, water thoroughly then empty the drainage tray. 
 Brown scorch marks 
  on leaves may be a symptom of exposure to hot, direct sunlight. Or  
 brown spots 
  may be caused by fungus. If you mist your plant, or clean it with water, don't allow water drops to stay on the leaves. While foliage dries quickly outdoors with good air circulation, indoor plants may stay wet for several hours, leading to fungus. It's a good idea to cut off affected leaves. Don't worry -- this vigorous vine will soon replace them. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
 The only problem I've had with this easy-going philodendron is 
 fungus gnats 
 . Those tiny, black insects are attracted to wet, peaty potting mixes. They're difficult to see, but you may find them crawling on the surface. This plant is somewhat drought-tolerant, so I allowed the top couple inches of potting medium to dry out and the fungus gnats disappeared. 
 Aphids 
 are attracted to new growth on soft-stemmed plants, like this one. Treat any infestation right away to avoid pests from traveling on to your other indoor plants. 
  
 Heartleaf Philodendron Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
  Climbs or trails to 4 ft (1.2 m) or more. 
 Light: 
  Moderate to bright light.  
 Small leaves or long spaces between leaves show that the plant is not getting enough light. 
 Move heartleaf philodendron plant to a brighter location, but not into direct sun which can scorch its leaves. It thrives under fluorescent light, too, making it an ideal office plant. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. Allow surface to dry out between waterings in winter. Yellow leaves 
 are caused by overwatering. Always use tepid water for your houseplants because cold water is a shock to these tropical natives. 
 Humidity: 
  Tolerant of dry air, but likes humidity. Try to maintain 40% relative humidity or higher. Check out these easy ways to  
 raise the humidity 
  around your tropical plants. Brown leaf tips are a symptom of dry air. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). Heartleaf philodendron will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced liquid or water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half. Don't feed in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-4 in/7-10 cm-long stem tip cuttings (each with at least 3 leaves attached) in spring or early summer. Cut just below a leaf  
 node 
  (the place where the leaf is attached to the stem). Nodes contain cells that will develop new roots. Philodendron roots easily in water or moist soil.

 Japanese Holly Fern 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Cyrtomium falcatum 
 Holly Fern is eye-catching on its own. But long fronds with thick, shiny green leaflets 
 make this a handsome addition to any indoor plant grouping. 
  
  
  
  
 Combine this easy-care fern among variegated foliage plants, such as snow bush, colorful coleus -- or one of the prayer plants. 
 Broad, asymmetrical leaflets are about 3-4 inches (8-10 cm) long with sawtoothed edges. Although it resembles the holly plant, 
 the two aren't related. 
 Less fussy about humidity than most common indoor ferns, it flourishes in the home with little care. It is better behaved, too. 
 Unlike many ferns,  
 Cyrtomium falcatum 
 does not shed. 
  
 Repot in spring 
  because Holly Fern begins its most vigorous time of growth in summer. When repotting, 
 make sure the crown of the plant is slightly above the soil line to prevent rot. Use a pot with 
 drainage holes so that the soil won't get soggy. Now that you have your fern out of its container, this is a 
 good time to divide it, if you want. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Watch for  
 scale insects 
 , 
 that look like small, brown discs on leaflets. (Sometimes the brown spores on the undersides of leaflets are mistaken for 
 scale. You'll recognize the spores because they appear in two rows under each pinnae.) To remove scale insects, 
 scrape them off with your fingernails. Don't use insecticides on ferns because they are easily damaged by chemicals. 
 Keep it clean. 
  Those 
 green leaflets are naturally glossy. Keep them clean by wiping them off with a damp cloth. Or take it to the sink for a lukewarm shower. 
  
 Buy Holly Fern and Houseplant Supplies 
  
 You'll find Holly Fern for sale by its botanical name. Look for 
 Cyrtomium falcatum 
 to be sure you're 
 getting this plant. 
 It's well-worth seeking. This is one of the easiest ferns to grow indoors and makes 
 a lush accent for your home. 
  
  
  
 Growing Tips for Holly Fern 
  
 Photo credit:  
 Helen Poirier 
  
 Origin: 
  Japan and China 
 Height: 
  Fronds grow to 2 ft (60 cm), but tend to sprawl out rather than up. 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect light 
 Water: 
 Aim to keep the potting medium lightly moist at all times, but not soggy which can lead to root rot. Use a pot with a drainage hole. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate (around 40-50% relative humidity). If the air is dry, mist the plant every morning or stand the pot on a tray 
 of wet pebbles. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose houseplant potting mix.

 Iresine herbstii 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Iresine herbstii 
 Bright red leaves with prominent red veins are the attraction of this Brazilian plant. 
 Luckily for us, this tropical native happens to 
 adapt well to being indoors, making it a spectacular room accent. 
  
 You can see why Iresine gets the common names bloodleaf plant and beefsteak plant. 
  
 Many varieties have lance-shaped leaves (as shown here) but some are more rounded. The leaves grow 3-6 inches (8-16 cm) long, in opposite pairs. 
 Small, greenish-white flowers may appear in summer. You can pinch them off, if you want, because they 
 aren't nearly as stunning as the brilliant foliage. 
  
 Year-Round Care 
  
 This tropical native needs warmth, humidity and plenty of light to thrive. Put it near a window or in a sunroom 
 to maintain its vibrant color. If you set it on your porch or patio for the summer, keep it shaded from hot, direct sunlight. 
 Repot in spring. 
  When you see roots growing out of the drainage holes, it is time to repot. Move 
 it up to a container just 1-2 inches larger, using a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. If you want to use a container without drainage holes, use it as a cachepot. Just slip a plain nursery pot into the cachepot. I put pebbles in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. As the water evaporates, it adds humidity around the plant -- and this tropical native will love it. 
 Prune it back. 
 Spring is the best time to prune this shrubby perennial. It's fast-growing and responds well to pruning. As older leaves fall off, it will become leggy as it grows. Cut off soft stem tips to keep Iresine herbstii compact. Don't toss out those cuttings, either. Pot them 
 up to grow more plants (see "Propagation" below). 
 Watch for  
 aphids 
 . 
  These tiny pests are attracted to the 
 soft, new growth on plants. Aphids feed by sucking sap from a plant, weakening it and causing distorted foliage. 
 Treat any infestation immediately. 
  
 Iresine Herbstii Varieties 
  
 This vibrant foliage plant is commonly known as Blood Leaf, Beefsteak and sometimes Chicken Gizzard. Popular cultivars include 'Aureoreticulata' which has green leaves with yellow veins and red stems, and 'Brilliantissima' with bright-pink veins. 
  
 Iresine Herbstii Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  Up to 2 ft (60 cm) when grown in a pot indoors 
 Light: 
  Bright light is necessary to prevent the bright leaf color from fading. Shade the plant from hot, direct summer sun. It thrives under  
 indoor grow lights 
 . Leggy plants aren't getting enough light. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, aiming to keep the potting mix lightly moist at all times. 
 Empty drainage tray to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. Water less in winter, when growth has slowed. Older plants are drought-tolerant. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 50% relative humidity or higher. Use a  
 humidity tray 
 or room humidifier 
  to raise the moisture in the air around it. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C. Don't expose Iresine to temps below 
 55°F/13°C. This tender perennial prefers to stay warm, like we do. 
 Soil: 
  Any good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. Don't feed in winter when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-4 in (8-10 cm) soft stem tip cuttings in early spring and root them in moist perlite. They 
 root easily.

 Iron Cross Begonia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Begonia masoniana 
 Iron cross begonia leaves are easily recognizable. Each bright-green puckered 
 leaf is marked with a reddish-brown iron-cross pattern in the center. 
  
  
  
 You may see sprays of pinkish-white flowers in spring and summer, but these blooms are insignificant 
 compared to the magnificent foliage. Pinching off flower buds will promote bigger, healthier leaves. 
 Iron cross begonia looks stunning when planted with other fancy-leafed begonias, such as 
 Begonia Rex 
 . Their contrasting leaf textures, colors and patterns complement each other in a dish garden. 
 If your plant suddenly collapses and shrivels up, don't give up on it. It's not uncommon for this begonia to go dormant in winter. 
 While it's tempting to overwater a withered plant -- stop watering during dormancy. What this handsome begonia really craves is high 
 humidity. Cover the plant with plastic or a  
 glass cloche 
  
 and keep the plant around 60°F/16°C for 6-8 weeks. You'll see new leaves appear. 
  
 Distinctive markings make this fancy-leaf begonia a beautiful addition to your houseplant collection. 
  
 Growing Iron Cross Begonia Year-Round 
  
 Shed some light. 
  Give your begonia bright, indirect light. You'll get the best 
 leaf color this way. It thrives under  
 fluorescent lights 
 . 
 Repot in spring. 
 Move your plant up to a pot only 1 size larger. Using a small pot with 
 a drainage hole will help to prevent overwatering. Tamp down the soil gently with your fingers so that 
 it doesn't pack too tightly -- begonias like a little air around their roots. 
 Pinch your plant. 
  Is your begonia too tall and leggy? You can pinch off stems to keep it compact. Don't toss out those stem cuttings either -- propagate them for more plants. (See "Propagation" below). Leggy plants may indicate the plant isn't getting enough light, especially if it's "reaching" toward the window. 
 Don't overwater. 
  This is one of the few problems with growing begonias.  
 Begonia masoniana 
  has 
 rhizomatous roots that store water, so allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. 
 Also watch for  
 powdery mildew 
 on leaves 
 and stems. Poor air circulation and high humidity are favorable conditions for this dusty, white fungus. 
 Cut off affected leaves and be sure your plant has air circulation around it. However, 
 keep it away from heat/AC vents, which can be drying. Treat foliage with a fungicide when needed. 
  
 Iron Cross Begonia Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia 
 Height: 
 Up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. If you're using fluorescent lights, keep the light on 14 hours a day -- that's the equivalent of about 8 hours of daylight. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, allowing the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Avoid getting water on the leaves because they spot easily and are prone to mildew and other fungus. 
 Humidity: 
 This fancy-leaf begonia likes 50% relative humidity or higher. If the air in your home is dry, use a cool-mist humidifier or place pot on a tray of wet pebbles to 
 increase humidity 
 . 
 Grouping tropical plants such as begonias, ferns and orchids also helps to increase the moisture in the air around them. 
 Misting begonias is not a good idea because it can promote powdery mildew 
 and fungal diseases. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C). Begonias are not cold-tolerant 
 and can be damaged by temperatures below 50°F/13°C. 
 Soil:  
 Peat moss based with added perlite and/or vermiculite for faster drainage. A 
 frican violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly year-round with a 10-10-5 water-soluble 
 fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Fertilize when the soil is already moist to avoid fertilizer burn. Don't feed a dormant plant. 
 Propagation: 
 Stem cuttings root easily. Take 3 in (8 cm) stem cuttings with leaves in early summer and 
 root them in moist, sterile potting mix. Cover with plastic or a glass cloche to raise humidity around it until 
 new leaves form.

 'Janet Craig' Dracaena 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Dracaena deremensis 
 'Janet Craig' is one of the few plants that have taken on the name of a cultivar as a common name. But then, few 
 are as easy to grow and welcome in the home as this attractive Dracaena plant. 
 Its dramatic form makes a striking floor plant. 
  
 "Janet" is well worth getting to know. Although tropical by nature, it adapts 
 beautifully to average home conditions. In fact, it does so well on its own, you 
 don't need to fuss over it at all. 
 Young plants are a tuft of upright leaves. As the plant grows, it forms a cane-like 
 stem with a cluster of leaves at its top. 
 Its dark-green leaves are naturally shiny. Because of their upright form, they can be 
 dust-catchers. Keep the leaves clean by wiping them off with a damp cloth. 
 Prune it back if it grows too tall. If you want, you can propagate the stem cuttings for more plants. 
  
  
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Prune in spring or early summer 
 to control its growth. You can cut off the cane at any height. It will sprout a 
 new cluster of leaves from where it was cut. 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
  only when the roots have filled the pot. Young plants may need repotted every 2-3 years. Use a 
 pot with a drainage hole to prevent overwatering. 
 Problems with this  
 Dracaena 
  are few. Watch for  
 webbing between leaves 
 . 
 Spider mites 
  may attack during the 
 winter months when the air is dry. Unfortunately, they're difficult to detect until the infestation is severe. Treat your plant 
 right away with insecticidal soap. 
 Dropped leaves 
  are likely caused by soil that's either too wet or too dry. Water thoroughly to wet all the 
 roots, then allow soil to dry slightly before watering again. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  indicate dry soil or a build up of soluble salts. Soluble salts come 
 from the chemicals in tap water and fertilizers and can damage foliage and roots. It's a good idea to flush salts 
 from the soil every year. 
  
 How to Flush Salts: 
  Take your plant outdoors on a warm day (keeping it shaded 
 from direct sunlight). Slowly pour lukewarm water over the soil. Allow water to drain out the drainage 
 holes. Pour more water through the pot, then empty the drainage tray. Flushing salts every 
 a year will make your plant healthier and takes only minutes to do. 
  
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 Look for the cultivar 'Janet Craig' to be sure you're getting this plant. Other dracaena species look similar. 
 D. deremensis 'Compacta' is a much smaller variety that only grows to 2 ft (60 cm) tall. 
  
 Janet Craig Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Tropical East Africa 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) if not pruned back 
 Light: 
 Moderate to bright light. Keep plant out of direct sunlight which can scorch its leaves, 
 leaving brown marks. Pale leaves can indicate that light is too low. 
 Water: 
 'Janet Craig' Dracaena will tolerate many abuses, but not soggy soil. Water thoroughly, allowing 
 the top inch (2.5 cm) of the soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Water less in winter, when light levels are lower and growth has slowed. 
 Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent wet soil. 
 Overwatering will cause leaves to turn yellow and fall off. 
 Humidity: 
  40-50% relative humidity. Discover easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C)  
 Soil: 
  Any good-quality potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly year-round with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root them in moist soil.

 Japanese Aralia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Fatsia japonica 
 Japanese aralia is a member of the Araliaceae family commonly grown outdoors in frost-free climates. Indoors, it 
 can be kept small by regular pruning. Cut it back drastically in spring -- by half when necessary -- and pinch 
 off growing tips to encourage branching. 
  
  
  
  
 Long, upright leaf stems hold glossy, lobed leaves with pointed tips. Each leaf has between 7-9 lobes and 
 can reach up to 12 in (30 cm) across. 
 Wipe the leaves frequently with 
 a damp cloth to keep them dust-free. 
 DO NOT use leaf shine products, which can damage them. 
 Clusters of creamy-white flowers may appear on mature plants in fall, followed by green 
 fruit that turn black as they ripen. However, it rarely flowers indoors. 
 This fast-growing, evergreen shrub is easy to care for. You can keep it happy by watering regularly. 
 Repot in spring 
  when the plant becomes root-bound. Use a heavy container to prevent toppling, 
 because plants can get top-heavy. Larger plants can be top-dressed instead by replacing the top 
 2-3 in (5-7.5 cm) with fresh potting mix. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy potting mix, which can cause root rot. 
 Watch for pests 
 . Check leaves regularly for  
 spider mites 
 , 
 aphids 
 and  
 mealy bugs 
 . 
 Treat any infestation immediately. 
 You can move Japanese aralia outdoors in summer if you want. Just be sure to put it in a shaded spot outside because 
 direct sun can burn its leaves. The cool, moist and shady environment  
 F. japonica 
  prefers may attract 
 botrytis 
 . Remove any affected leaves 
 and spray with a fungicide. It's a good idea to keep the plant where it will get good air circulation. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
  This plant needs a rest in winter. It won't go dormant, but its growth will slow down. Move it to a cool spot where the temperature doesn't dip below 
 45°F/7°C , water less frequently and stop fertilizing for the winter. 
  
 Japanese Aralia Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Japan 
 Height: 
 To 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors 
 Light: 
 Bright light; no direct summer sun which can scorch its leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall, slightly drier in winter when growth slows down. 
 Humidity: 
 Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter. Discover easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 50-55°F/10-13°C nights; 60-65°F/16-18°C days 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Yellow leaves on this plant indicate lack of nitrogen. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4-inch (10cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and place in moist perlite or sterile potting mix.

 Jerusalem Cherry Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Solanum pseudocapsicum 
 Branches loaded with brightly colored fruit make Jerusalem Cherry a favorite ornamental indoor plant in 
 fall and winter. 
  
  
  
 Fruits look festive, turning from green to red late in the year. Photo: Marjon Besteman-Horn 
  
 White, star-shaped flowers cover this shrubby plant in summer. Beginning in fall, the flowers are followed by small, 
 round fruits that turn from green to yellow to orange to red as they slowly ripen. They are long-lasting and will "decorate" 
 the plant right through the winter. 
 Although the fruits look a lot like cherry tomatoes and may seem tempting, 
 they are poisonous 
 and should not be eaten 
 . 
 Keep Jerusalem Cherry plant away from 
 children and pets who may be tempted by this colorful houseplant. 
 You'll find these ornamental plants for sale just about any time of year. 
 They're sometimes sold as 
 Christmas Cherry 
 or 
 Christmas Pepper 
 around the holidays. 
  
 How to Care for Jerusalem Cherry 
  
 Let the sun shine in. 
  Jerusalem Cherry makes an attractive patio plant, where it will get the direct sun it needs to 
 grow, flower and produce fruit. Just be sure to bring this tender perennial back inside before the temperature drops in autumn. 
 This South American native is frost-tender. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
  After the fruit is no longer attractive, cut the stems back by half. Reduce watering, 
 but don't allow the soil to dry out completely. Place the plant in a cooler spot (around 60°/16°C). 
 In late spring, move it back to a sunny window -- or outdoors after the last threat of frost has passed -- and resume 
 normal care. 
 Got a reluctant bloomer? 
  Plants that don't bloom usually aren't getting enough light. The cool rest 
 followed by a warm, sunny summer should trigger a flush of new flowers followed by fruit. Don't forget to 
 fertilize during the growing season. Plants grown in pots need to be fed regularly. Got blooms, but no fruit? 
 Plants kept for a second year may bloom, but not produce fruit because they 
 aren't pollinated. Don't worry -- it's easy to do. 
  
 How to pollinate your plant: 
  Plants grown outdoors 
 get pollinated from the wind or insects that carry the pollen from flower to flower. If you've kept 
 your plant indoors, it needs some help from you. Use a small, clean paintbrush to dab the 
 stamens in the center of the flowers, moving from flower to flower to spread the pollen around. 
  
  
 Repot root-bound plants in spring. 
  Move up to a pot 1 size bigger to give it a little space. Use a pot with a drainage 
 hole to prevent over-watering, which can lead to root rot. 
 Deal with pests. 
 Something bugging your plant? Jerusalem Cherry is sometimes infested by aphids, 
 whiteflies or spider mites. Regular misting with tepid water will help to prevent an infestation 
 of spider mites, which prefer hot, dry conditions. Use an insecticide, if needed. Organic 
 neem oil insecticide 
  is an effective 
 treatment for many pests. 
  
 Jerusalem Cherry Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
 1-2 ft (30-60 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 Put your plant in a bright location where it will get a few hours of direct sun each day. 
 You can move it outdoors for the summer, if you want. Bring it in before the first frost and 
 you'll enjoy its colorful display through the holiday season. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy. Reduce watering in spring, after the fruit has fallen off and the plant is resting. Always use lukewarm water to water your tropical plants; cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
  Aim to maintain 40-50% relative humidity around the plant. Mist the plant every day in summer and stand the 
 pot on a  
 tray of wet pebbles 
 . Keep the plant away from heat/air vents. Blasts of dry air will cause the fruits 
 to shrivel and fall off early. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). If you move your plant outdoors 
 for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. If won't, however, tolerate frost. In 
 the fall and winter months, keeping it on the cool side 
 (around 60°/16°C) 
 will help the fruit to last longer. 
 Soil: 
  Any good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a tomato fertilizer, which has the micro-nutrients this plant needs. 
 Propagation: 
  Stem cuttings or seeds. Take stem cuttings in spring and root them in moist potting mix. 
 Gather seeds from ripe fruits and sow in pots indoors in early spring.

 Juncus Effusus 'Spiralis' 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Juncus effusus 
 'Spiralis' 
 Corkscrew rush (sometimes called Juncus spiralis) is a novelty cultivar with captivating coiled stems, 
 spreading out in every direction as they grow. 
  
  
 If you like unusual indoor plants, you'll want to add this spectacular ornamental to your collection. 
 Stunning on its own, corkscrew rush also adds some sizzle among a display of leafy and flowering plants. In 
 fact, those curly-Q stems are sometimes used in florists' bouquets. 
 Perennial and evergreen, this is an easy-care house plant. It adds a lot of personality to a room for little effort. 
  
 Juncus Effusus 
  'Spiralis': 3 Keys to Success 
  
 Water generously. 
 Constantly wet soil is needed to keep  
 Juncus effusus 
  'Spiralis' healthy and thriving. Don't allow the soil to dry out. Foliage will turn yellow then brown if it 
 gets too dry. It's a good idea to keep your corkscrew rush plant in a pot without a drainage hole. 
 Juncus is native to marsh areas, so it loves soggy soil --  
 even standing water 
 . 
 Shed some light. 
 Put your Juncus plant in your sunniest window -- or shift it outdoors for the spring 
 and summer. It will tolerate lower light levels, but won't grow much. If you don't 
 have a spot near a window,  
 grow lights 
  work beautifully. 
 Repot in spring 
 , moving up to a container 1 size larger when it becomes crowded. Juncus is fast-growing 
 when it gets the sunlight and water it wants. You may need to divide it every spring. 
  
 Juncus Effusus 'Spiralis' Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
 'Spiralis' is a cultivar of Juncus effusus, native to Japan. 
 Height: 
 2-3 ft (60-90 cm)  
 Light: 
 Give it as much full sun as you can. It will tolerate some indirect light. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil wet at all times -- standing water is ideal. Native to marshlands, this is one 
 plant you can't overwater. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity. Discover easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  around your plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. 
 If you put this tender ornamental out on the patio for the summer, bring it back in 
 when the temperature drops. It won't tolerate frost. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix, such as African violet mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once a month spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) liquid or water-soluble 
 fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 In spring, divide the plant by gently pulling the fleshy roots apart or cut through them with a knife; then pot separately.

 How to Grow Kentia Palm 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Howea forsteriana 
 Over many years, a kentia palm tree can reach several feet in height, making it a striking, tropical floor plant. Give it 
 some elbow room, too. Those elegant, arching fans can grow as much as 1 ft (30 cm) wide and at least 2 ft (60 cm) long. 
  
  
  
  
 All of them grow from a single trunk, but growers typically plant several together for a lush, full appearance. 
 This is hands-down one of the most popular indoor palm trees, and it's easy to see why. 
 The palm family is large, but only a few kinds of palm trees are tolerant of average home conditions. This 
 dramatic palm is one. 
  
 How to Care for Kentia Palm Indoors 
  
 Give it a shower. 
 Keep the fronds dust-free by giving your palm a shower. This has the added benefit 
 of flushing the soil of built-up fertilizer. Use a gentle flow of tepid water. Or stand the plant outdoors 
 for a gentle summer (warm) rain shower. Remember to keep your palm out of direct sun. 
 Watch for  
 scale insects 
 . 
  They 
 look like brown oval bumps that tend to lurk on the undersides of the leaflets. Treat any infestation immediately. Dry indoor air can attract  
 spider mites 
  to indoor plants; if left untreated, they can cause a lot of damage to a plant then move on to your other houseplants. Maintaining humidity is the best prevention for these pests --  
 and your tropical palm will love it 
 . 
 Repot only when needed. 
  Planting palm trees is only necessary every 3 years at the most. Kentias 
 are slow-growing and don't like to be disturbed. Their roots are fragile, so handle them carefully. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  are common even on healthy palms. Boosting the humidity around your plant will help. Watch humidity levels, especially during the winter months when indoor air can become extremely dry. 
  
 Kentia Palm Indoor Care 
  
 Origin: 
  Lord Howe Island (Northeast of Australia) 
 Height: 
  Grows slowly, but can reach up to 8 ft (2.4 m) indoors 
 Light: 
  
 Kentias tolerate shade better than some, but you'll get a healthier, greener plant 
 by giving your palm bright, indirect light year-round. Take care not to put it in direct sunlight, which may cause 
 brown scorch marks on its leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. In winter, allow the top half of the soil to dry out before watering again. Too much water will cause leaves to turn yellow then brown. To keep Kentia palm looking its best, brown fronds can be cut off. 
 Humidity: 
 Kentia palm likes high humidity (around 50-60% relative humidity). 
  
 If the relative humidity 
 drops below 40%, use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . Brown leaf tips are a symptom of dry air, although this is common even on healthy palms. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C. Kentia palm can tolerate a minimum of 
 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix with added horticultural sand for quick drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly in spring and summer. Organic palm fertilizer 
 contains the micronutrients this palm needs. Don't feed in fall and winter when growth has slowed. 
 Propagation: 
  Kentia seeds can be grown with a grow light and heat mat, but seedlings are slow-growing. You'll wait for years for seedlings to grow into a tall palm tree.

 Lady Palm 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Rhapis excelsa 
  
 Lady Palm is a dramatic, tall house plant that is easy to grow. Give one a place with bright, indirect 
 sunlight and you'll enjoy it for many years.

 You can fit this palm in just about anywhere -- its fronds 
 don't branch out widely, so it only takes up vertical space in a room. 
 Fronds grow in a fan pattern, each consisting of deeply veined leaflets that grow up to 12 inches 
 (30 cm) long and 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. 
 You'll find that the number of leaflets on each stem will vary -- typically 5 to 10 -- but that 
 just adds to this beautiful palm's appeal. In fact, I've never seen two Lady Palms exactly alike. 
 A member of the palm family, this elegant-looking plant grows in a clump of woody, upright stems. 
 As the lower leaves fall off, they leave scars on the stems, creating an attractive bamboo-like 
 appearance. 
 Repot in spring 
 only every 3-4 years, or when this palm outgrows its container. This plant grows best when 
 slightly root-bound, so keep it in a smallish container. Keeping Lady Palm confined to a small container will also 
 dramatically limit its size. In fact, it can be grown in a bonsai pot. When the tree grows to more than 3 ft (90 cm) 
 tall, top dress instead. 
  
 How to top-dress a plant: 
  Remove the top 2-3 inches of soil and replace 
 with fresh soil every couple years. Take care not to harm any roots that may be near the surface. 
  
  
 Keep it moist. 
  Palms are  
 not 
  desert plants. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy, during 
 the growing season. Mist the foliage daily or use a room humidifier if the air is dry. Brown leaf tips are caused 
 by irregular watering and dry air. Snip off 
 the brown tips with scissors, if you want. 
 This palm's problems are few, although dry air may attract  
 spider mites 
  
 to its leaves. Wiping off leaves with a damp cloth from time to time will do double-duty, removing dust and keeping those pests away. 
 Want another reason to love your palm? It cleans the air you breathe. Lady Palm is o 
 ne of the best plants for improving air quality indoors. It has one of the top removal rates of 
 toxins such as formaldehyde and ammonia. 
  
 Rhapis Excelsa Varieties 
  
 This is a slow-growing palm so buy one the size you want. 
 More than 100 named cultivars are available, most with Asian names. 
 'Koban' 
 is a popular cultivar with dark-green leaves. 
 'Zuikonishki' 
 has green leaflets with white stripes... 
 'Gyokuho' 
 is a dwarf variety, as is 
 'Kodaruma' 
 , the smallest of all, reaching only a few inches high. 
  
 Lady Palm Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast China 
 Height: 
  Up to 10 ft (3 m) outdoors. It stays smaller when grown in a container. In fact, it can be grown as a bonsai plant, reaching only 12 in (30 cm) high. 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. Too much sun will cause the leaves to turn yellow-green. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist in spring and summer. In winter, allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings. 
 Like other palms, it is sensitive to fluoride and other chemicals in tap water, causing leaf tips to turn brown. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (around 50% relative humidity or higher). 
 Brown leaf tips may indicate that indoor air is dry. It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge rather than guess. Use a cool-mist room humidifier, if needed. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer, or a light sprinkling of 
 time-released houseplant fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds or division

 Lucky Bamboo House Plants 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Dracaena sanderiana 
  
  
  
  
  
 Lucky Bamboo first hit the garden centers in the late 1990s. Care for indoor bamboo plant couldn't be easier: it will grow 
 in a vase of water with pebbles to keep it upright. 
 This striking bamboo plant has a slender, upright stem and graceful, arching green leaves that taper to a point. 
 Its roots are red -- so don't worry if you see red roots in the vase. This is normal for a healthy plant. 
 It's not really a bamboo. This member of the  
 Dracaena 
 family has been around a long time, but has become a favorite 
 of feng shui enthusiasts because it is believed to enhance chi energy and bring good luck. 
 You won't need luck to grow it, though.  
 Dracaenas 
  find homes in many offices and dorms because they can be ignored for days 
 (or weeks!) without suffering from neglect. 
  
 How to Care for Lucky Bamboo 
  
 Give your bamboo house plant bright light to help it look its best, but  
 keep this plant out of direct sun 
 to avoid burning its foliage. 
 It's a good idea to  
 use an opaque vase 
 . Sunlight coming through clear glass will encourage the growth of algae. If 
 the water becomes murky, just clean the vase and pebbles and refill it with clear water. 
 Indoor bamboo problems are few. 
 Yellow leaves are usually caused by too much sun or too much fertilizer. Cut back on fertilizer and move your 
 bamboo plant to a shadier spot. Brown leaves indicate dry air or chemicals present in the water. (See watering tips below.) 
 Stalks that turn soft and mushy are probably beyond saving. Remove them right away to avoid contaminating the other 
 stalks. If you want to try to save them, you can cut off the mushy parts and place the trimmed stalks in fresh water. 
  
  
 Lucky bamboo pruning 
  will keep your plant in good shape. Don't cut the main stalk -- just cut the offshoots within 
 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) of the main stalk. This will cause new shoots to grow, creating a fuller, bushier plant. Don't throw those 
 cuttings away, either -- root them in fresh water to start new plants. 
 Wondering how to make those twists and curves? 
 Although often compared to bonsai, this bamboo house plant is not shaped with 
 wire and frequent trimming. Instead, it is shaped by rotating the plant's stalks. Turning a stalk slowly and regularly 
 in front of a light source naturally causes the stalk to grow toward the light. This is a labor-intensive process 
 and difficult to do in the home. 
  
 Lucky Bamboo Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Africa 
 Height: 
  Up to 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, but no direct sun which will scorch leaves. 
 Pale leaves indicate the plant is not getting enough light. Move it to a brighter location, out of direct sunlight. 
 Lucky bamboo thrives under fluorescent light, making it an ideal plant for the office. 
 Water: 
 Change the water every week or two. This plant is sensitive to chlorine, fluoride, and other chemicals often found in tap water. Use only distilled or bottled water, or allow tap water to sit overnight so the chemicals will dissipate. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
   
 Dracaenas 
  like warm temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. 
 Soil: 
  N/A 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 months with an all-purpose liquid fertilizer. Just a drop will do. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem cuttings in summer and stand in fresh water.

 How to Grow Maidenhair Fern Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Adiantum raddianum 
 Maidenhair Fern is a foliage plant with arching, black, wiry fronds covered with green triangular 
 leaflets, called  
 pinnae 
 . 
  
  
  
  
 One of the most commonly grown in a container, 
 Adiantum raddianum 
 is well-worth growing for its stunning foliage. It 
 will live a long time, too, if you can meet its need for high humidity. 
 This beautiful fern grows from rhizomes, that spread quickly just under the surface of the soil. It can reach a width of 
 24 in (60 cm) or more. You'll enjoy many plants over time by propagating this fern. It's easy to divide. 
  
 Repot in spring when it has outgrown its pot, using a container that provides good drainage. This is a good time to divide 
 the fern, if needed. 
 Not many pests bother Maidenhair Fern. However,  
 scale 
 and  
 mealybugs 
  are the most common. Check the fronds 
 regularly for infestations. They are much easier to remedy if caught early. 
 Somewhat difficult to grow, this tropical native demands high humidity which is not practical in most homes. Grows best 
 in  
 terrariums 
 where humidity is kept at a high level. 
 Drafts and dry air will cause leaflets to shrivel. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Cut the stems off at the base if the leaflets dry up or fall off. Keep soil moist 
 and raise the humidity around the fern to encourage new growth. Mist twice a day until new shoots appear. 
  
  
 Yellow leaf tips 
 are often a sign of overwatering. Trim off yellow leaflets to keep the fern looking neat and reduce 
 watering. Also, check the roots to see if they have rotted. Healthy fern roots have white to light brown tips. 
 If the roots are mostly black,  
 get rid of it 
 -- it's too far gone. 
 Brown leaflets 
  may be caused by low humidity, although old fronds naturally turn brown. Cut them off and boost the 
 humidity around your fern. 
 Wilted fronds 
 are likely a symptom of underwatering. Always water thoroughly to avoid any dry pockets in the soil. 
 Repot in spring 
 . Don't pack the potting mixture; keep it loose to help drainage. You can encourage a small fern 
 to grow bigger by moving it to a slightly bigger pot. Want to keep your plant small? Remove the plant from its container 
 and prune off up to one-third of its roots before repotting it in the same pot. 
  
 Growing Tips for Maidenhair Fern 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil and Venezuela 
 Height: 
 6-15 inches (15-38 cm). 
 Light: 
  Moderate to bright light. No direct sun. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist, but not soggy. 
 Humidity: 
  Requires moist air that rarely drops below 50% relative humidity. For a healthy plant, use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  or plant in a terrarium. Brown leaf tips are a symptom of dry air. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C) 
 Soil: 
  Combine half potting mix with half peat moss. Don't use potting mix that contains fertilizer (it can dissolve too fast and burn delicate fern roots). 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once a month spring through summer with a balanced houseplant fertilizer diluted by half. Fertilize 
 after watering to prevent burning roots. 
 Propagation: 
 Division. This fern grows from rhizomes that spread horizontally just beneath the surface of the soil. 
 Divide clump in spring, leaving rhizome attached to 1-2 fronds, and pot in its own container.

 Ming Aralia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Polyscias fruticosa 
 Ming aralia only  
 looks 
  fussy. Its stems carry compound leaves 
 made up of several leaflets, giving the fancy, finely cut foliage an elegant quality you'd expect 
 from a high-maintenance plant. 
 Fortunately for us, this tropical native is extremely adaptable to most homes. 
 Put it in full sun -- or indirect light. It's quite happy just about anywhere. Keep this aralia plant warm, 
 though. It doesn't like cold temperatures at all. (Who can blame it?) 
  
  
  
 Ming Aralia Care Tips 
  
 Prune. 
  Ming aralia has an upright habit and won't grow very tall. Over time, it will drop its lower leaves, 
 revealing a gnarled tree-like trunk. If you want, you can keep it short and shrubby by cutting it back every spring. 
 You'll make it even more beautiful with regular pruning. Prune off the growing tips to encourage branching and 
 denser foliage. Trimming Ming aralia bonsai plant will keep it at 1 ft (30 cm) or less. 
 Repot in spring 
 only when it has outgrown its pot. Use the smallest pot that will hold its roots -- 
 aralias grow best when their roots are confined. Pot taller plants in a heavy container to prevent toppling. 
 Mings are easily killed by overwatering, so use a pot with a drainage hole. 
 Leaf drop. 
 If your Ming suddenly starts shedding leaves, don't panic. 
 Some leaf drop is normal. Is it growing new leaves at the stem tips? If so, this is just part of the normal growth. 
 A sudden change in light, such as moving your plant to a shadier location, may cause leaf drop. 
 Give it as much light as you can. Raising the humidity around it can help, too. 
 Problems with this plant are few. It even seems to shrug off pests. Keep this tropical plant warm and don't 
 overwater -- and you'll enjoy it for many years. 
 If you're looking for a beautiful floor plant, give Ming aralia a try. But be warned, this easy-care house plant 
 just may spoil you for anything else. 
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 You'll find Ming aralia for sale by its common name, although other types of aralia plants 
 are sometimes labeled with the same name. Look for  
 Polyscias fruticosa 
  to be sure you're 
 getting this plant. 
 It's well-worth seeking out. With good care, this aralia is a long-lived plant and a lush, 
 graceful accent for your home. 
  
 Growing Tips for Ming Aralia 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Polynesia 
 Height: 
  Up to 3 ft (90 cm); can be grown as a bonsai tree. 
 Light: 
  Aim for bright light, though it will tolerate varying levels from low light to full sun. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly and allow top 2 in (5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering 
 is a sure way to kill it. Mings have fine roots and are prone to root rot, so when in doubt, keep it on the 
 dry side. Also cut back on water in the winter when growth has slowed. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high humidity. If the air is dry, mist the plant every morning or stand the pot on a tray 
 of wet pebbles. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-85°F/18-29°C. It can take warmer temperatures, but 
 don't expose it to anything below 60°. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix with perlite added for good drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer (such as 10-10-10) 
 diluted by half. Young leaves that are yellowish-green are caused by a lack of nutrients. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in late spring or summer. Cut just below a leaf node (the place 
 where the leaf attaches to the stem) and remove the lower leaves from the cutting. For best results, dip cut end in hormone 
 rooting powder before inserting in moist potting mix. Cover with a plastic bag to hold in the humidity. 
 Keep as warm as possible and out of direct sunlight. It can take a few weeks to root, so be patient.

 Money Tree Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pachira aquatica 
  
 Money tree plant care is easy. Just put it where it'll get some indirect sunlight. Water thoroughly and allow 
 the soil to dry out a bit between waterings. 
 Its thin trunks are often braided by growers to add to its appeal. Each spoke-like leaf has 5-7 bright-green leaflets. 
  
  
  
 Wondering why 
 Pachira aquatica 
 is called money tree? According to feng shui, money tree will bring good luck and fortune. No, your money tree plant won't actually grow currency, but it is a good investment. Treat it well, and you'll enjoy this delightful tree for many years. 
  
 How to Take Care of  
 Pachira aquatica 
  Year-Round 
  
 Don't overpot 
 . Use a smallish container because a too-big container will hold too much water. Soggy 
 potting mix is often the biggest problem with this plant, causing stem and root rot and yellowing/dropping leaves. Growing 
 money tree in a small container will also prevent it from getting too big. In fact, this tree can be grown as a bonsai. 
 Regular pruning will also help control its size. Pinch or prune off growing tips. 
 Give it a winter rest 
 . Keep your money tree warm and in bright light year-round. But cut back on water 
 and stop fertilizing in the winter months because growth slows down with lower light levels. 
 Brown, crispy leaves 
 is a symptom of dry air or low light levels. Plants often are in shock when 
 moved to a new home because they are adjusting to a new environment. Keep your plant away from heat/AC vents and 
 cold drafts from windows and entryways. 
  
 Dropped leaves 
 are also caused by relocation shock. If your new tree drops its leaves, don't give up on it. 
 They'll grow back with good care. Place your money tree in a bright location and leave it there. 
 Increasing humidity 
  
 around the plant can help. While it's tempting to overwater a shedding plant, don't. It only makes 
 the problem worse. 
  
 Money Tree Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
 Wetlands in Central and South America 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) tall 
 Light: 
  
 Find a bright spot for your money tree, out of direct sunlight, which can scorch its leaves. 
 It thrives 
 under 
  
 fluorescent light 
 , 
 making this small tree an ideal office plant. 
 Water: 
 Money tree plant likes water in big gulps. Water thoroughly, until water comes out the drainage 
 holes in the bottom of the pot, then allow the top 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) 
 to dry out between waterings. Take care not to allow the potting mix to get soggy, which can cause root rot. And avoid getting water on the trunk, which causes stem rot. 
 Cut back on water in the winter when growth slows. 
 Humidity: 
 This tropical native likes humid air. Try to keep the relative humidity at 50% or higher. Set the pot 
 on a tray of wet pebbles or use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round. 
 Soil: 
 Use a peat moss-based potting mix with perlite or sand added for good drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with an all-purpose water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds or stem tips. Take stem tip cuttings in spring, with at least 2 leaf nodes attached. 
 Dip the cut end in  
 rooting hormone powder 
  then insert it in moist potting mix. Be patient -- it can take several weeks to root.

 Moses in the Cradle 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Tradescantia spathacea 
  
 Moses in the Cradle is a popular house plant, related to the Wandering Jew plant. 
 You'll find that it's just as easy to grow. 
 Dark-green, lance-shaped leaves with purplish-red undersides make this a beautiful house plant year-round. 
 You can keep your plant indoors. But if you move it outdoors for the summer, keep it 
 shaded from direct sun. 
 Also, check the soil every couple days so that it doesn't dry out. 
  
  
  
  
 Pot it in a small decorative container for a stunning table accent. A newer variety, 
 Rhoeo discolor 
 'Variegata' is even more spectacular, with striped foliage in burgundy, pink, green and cream. 
  
 About the Flowers (How Moses in the Cradle Got its Name) 
  
 Tradescantia spathacea 
  blooms any time of year. Small, white, 3-petaled flowers grow in the leaf axils, nestled in 
 boat-shaped bracts, giving this plant its common names, 
 Moses in the Cradle, Moses in a Boat and Boat Lily.

 Moses in the Cradle Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 No flowers? 
 It's not getting enough sunlight. Grow your plant in bright, indirect light year-round to make it bloom. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  are caused by dry air. Raise the humidity in winter 
 by misting the foliage with tepid water daily, or using a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Or place the pot on a tray of wet pebbles to keep the air moist around it. 
 Repot in spring 
 when the plant becomes crowded, probably every couple years. Move up to a pot only 
 1 size larger to give it a little room to grow. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which leads to root rot. Want to use a decorative pot without drainage holes? Use it as a cachepot. Slip a plain nursery pot with drainage holes into the cachepot. I use small rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Something bugging your houseplant? 
   
 Spider mites 
  suck plant juices, leaving leaves pale, spotted and curled. Though you'll likely notice the webbing between leaves first -- the tell-tale sign of these destructive pests. Cut off any affected parts of the plant and treat with insecticidal soap immediately.  
 Aphids 
  may attack new growth of this plant, sucking plant juices and leaving a sticky residue on the leaves. Isolate any affected houseplant to prevent pests from moving on to nearby plants. 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 Tradescantia spathacea 
  was formerly known as  
 Rhoeo spathacea 
 and is sometimes sold under that name 
 in the nursery trade. One cultivar, 
  
 Rhoeo discolor 
 'Variegata' has grown in popularity and is highly sought-after. 
 You'll find Moses in the Cradle for sale from online nurseries and garden centers in spring and summer. 
  
 Moses in the Cradle Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico 
 Height: 
 1-2 ft (30-60 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 Grow your plant in bright, indirect light year-round for good foliage color and flowers. 
 It will tolerate lower light levels, but the leaves will be more green than purple. Keep it out of hot, midday sun. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. In winter, allow the potting medium to dry out slightly between waterings. Soft, limp stems may be caused by over-watering, which can lead to root rot. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate room (around 40% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry during the winter months, causing brown leaf tips on plants. It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor near your plants, rather than guess. S 
 tand the pot on a humidity tray or use a cool-mist room humidifier near the plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) suit this plant year-round. It will tolerate a minimum temperature of 55°F/13°C. Keep 
 Tradescantia spathacea 
 away from heat/AC vents, drafty doorways or windows -- it doesn't like fluctuating temperatures. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, all-purpose houseplant potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly with a balanced, water-soluble houseplant fertilizer in spring and summer, while plant is actively growing. 
 Propagation: 
 Division. Remove offshoots that grow around the plant with some roots attached and pot separately. Spring is the best time to propagate Moses in the Cradle because it is starting its most vigorous time of growth.

 Angel Vine (Muehlenbeckia Complexa) 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Muehlenbeckia complexa 
 Angel Vine is a sprawling shrub with 
 long, wiry stems, densely covered by 
 small, round leaves. Its growing habits make it a 
 versatile plant indoors. To show off its thickly leafed vines, put this trailing vine in 
 a hanging basket.

 Better yet, you can train its climbing, wiry stems around a trellis or topiary. Tie it loosely to a 
 support with florist's wire and Angel Vine will take on any shape you want. 
 Prune it back. 
  Angel Vine is fast-growing and needs some help from you to shape it or train it. Prune 
 off new stems regularly to encourage branching and to shape them as they grow. 
 Pruning up to one-third in spring will keep the plant compact. 
 Repot in spring 
 every 2 years, 
 moving to a pot 1 size larger or keep it in the same pot and just give it fresh potting mix. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent the potting medium from getting soggy.

 Muehlenbeckia Complexa Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  New Zealand 
 Height: 
  Up to 8-inches (20 cm); may trail or sprawl about 2-3 ft (60-91 cm) if not cut back 
 Light: 
  Partial sun to full, direct sunlight. If your plant has few leaves, it needs brighter light. If you don't have a sunny window, move the plant to a porch or patio for the summer; just be sure to bring it back indoors when the temperature drops in autumn. Or use a  
 grow light 
 . 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly when potting mix is dry 1 inch down. 
 Water less in winter, allowing the top 1/3 of the potting medium to dry out before watering again. Soggy soil will cause the leaves to turn yellow. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 30-40% relative humidity) 
 Temperature: 
  Keep warm (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. Avoid exposing plant to temperature extremes, including cold drafts from doors and windows or blasts from heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
  Use a good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. Commercial mixes have no soil in them at all, making them lightweight and fast-draining -- just right for this shrub. 
 Fertilizer: 
  
 Muehlenbeckia complexa 
  is not a heavy feeder. Fertilize once a month spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended amount. Stop feeding in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-4 inch stem tip cuttings in spring and root in perlite or fresh potting mix. Use  
 rooting hormone powder 
  to ensure the stems will quickly develop roots.

 Nerve Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Fittonia verschaffeltii 
 Nerve Plant has beautiful, deep-green leaves with vein patterns of white, pink, or red, making it a standout among house plants. 
  
  
  
 Contrasting veins on Fittonia verschaffeltii add color and texture, creating living art. 
  
 In its native South America, this tropical plant grows as a ground cover and can spread out about 12 inches (30 cm). 
 Its low-spreading habit makes it ideal for dish gardens and terrariums, where it thrives with the help of high humidity. 
 This plant grows best with even temperatures around 70°F/21°C. It doesn't like dry air, drafts, or direct sun, 
 any of which may cause its leaves to shrivel or fall off. 
  
 Group Your Plants 
  
 Nerve Plant grows beautifully in a dish garden or a  
 terrarium 
 . 
 Combine it with 2 or 3 of these humidity-loving plants: 
  
 Parlor Palm 
 Heartleaf Philodendron 
 Arrowhead Plant 
 English Ivy 
  
  
 Nerve Plants for Sale 
  
 You may find  
 Fittonia verschaffeltii 
  for sale by other common names, such as Silver Net Leaf 
 or Mosaic Plant. 
  
  
  
 Caring for Fittonia Year-Round 
  
 Pinch your plant. 
  Pinch off stem tips regularly to keep plant bushy and full. Also pinch off any small flower spikes that may appear, because 
 they are insignificant and will weaken the show of leaves. 
 Mist it. 
  This tropical beauty loves to be misted. Give it a fine spray of tepid water every morning to provide the moist air it 
 craves. Or place the pot on a tray of wet pebbles to raise the humidity around it. 
 Repot in spring 
  every couple years to refresh the soil. Nerve Plant has shallow roots, so you can keep it in a small pot.

 Nerve Plant Problems 
  
 Yellow leaves 
  are a symptom of too much water. Too-frequent watering or poor drainage will cause foliage to turn yellow. Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil that can lead to root rot. 
 Leaf drop 
  is likely caused by cold temperatures or drafts from nearby windows. This tropical native prefers the same warm temperatures that you do. 
 Dry, shriveled leaves 
  are a sign of dry air or direct sun exposure. Room humidity can drop drastically in the winter months. Use a room humidifier, if needed, and keep your plant out of direct sunlight. 
 Pests and diseases 
  sometimes arrive with a new plant. It's a good idea to look over your houseplants regularly for insects, sticky honeydew or sooty mold.  
 Aphids 
  are the most common pest for a young plant, because they feed on new growth. Treat any infestation immediately and isolate any affected plant to prevent pests from moving on to your other indoor plants. 
  
 Nerve Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Peru 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 in (15 cm) 
 Light: 
  Low to medium light. Avoid direct sunlight, which may cause shriveled leaves. Nerve plant grows well under a  
 grow light 
 . 
 Water: 
  Keep soil constantly moist. Nerve plant will collapse if it dries out. 
 Yellow leaves on this plant indicate too much water or poor drainage. 
 Fittonia needs moisture at all times, but it won't tolerate soggy soil. Cut off yellow leaves and allow soil 
 to dry slightly between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
  High humidity (around 60-70% relative humidity). Nerve plant grows well in the humid environment of a wardian case or a terrarium. Dry air will cause shriveled leaves. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. Fittonia will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C. It's a good idea to keep your tropical plants out of cold blasts from doorways and away from heat/AC vents, which can cause leaf drop. 
 Soil: 
  Peat-based mix with added perlite, such as African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2-3 months spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 2 in (5 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and insert them in moist potting mix. They propagate easily 
 in a warm, humid environment, rooting in about 2-3 weeks.

 Growing Norfolk Island Pine Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Araucaria heterophylla 
  
 Norfolk Island pine is an evergreen conifer that makes a handsome house plant. Its long, horizontal branches are 
 densely covered with short, soft needles that become darker as the plant ages. 
  
  
  
 Norfolk Island pine is tropical, and it loves warm temperatures and moist air. 
  
 This plant not a true pine, it just looks like one. It also gets its name from Norfolk Island -- a small island in the 
 Pacific between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. 
  
 In its native habitat, Norfolk Island pine can grow up to 200 ft (60 m) tall. 
 As a house plant, you can expect it to reach about 3-6 ft (90 cm - 1.8 m). Slow-growing, it will take 
 several years to reach this height. 
 To understand how to care for these plants, remember their native environment, where they enjoy moderate temperatures, 
 moist air and bright light. Dry air, dry soil and low light can cause the needles to drop -- and they won't grow back. 
 They need a little extra attention, but they're worth it. Norfolk pine trees will live a long time with good care. 
 You'll find Norfolk Island pine trees for sale from online nurseries and some garden centers in spring and summer. Small trees are sometimes decorated and sold around Christmastime. 
  
 Norfolk Island Pine Care 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 If you move your plant outdoors for the summer, keep it shaded from hot sun. Check the soil often and keep it moist. Norfolk pine is frost tender. In fact, it doesn't like the cold at all. Bring it back indoors if the temperature drops below 50°F/10°C. 
  
  
 Raise the humidity. 
  Dry air will cause the needles to become dry and fall off. Keep your plant away from heat/AC vents. 
 This Pacific Island native loves to be misted with room-temperature water. Or use a room humidifier to add moisture. 
 Keep soil moist. 
 Growing Norfolk Island pine trees are thirsty, so check the soil often during the growing season. 
 Yellow needles are typically caused by soil that's either too dry or soggy. Aim to keep it lightly moist at all times. 
 Repot in spring. 
 This plant is slow-growing, especially indoors. Move it into a pot 1 size larger every 3 years 
 or when roots are visible on top of the soil. When the tree grows to more than 3 ft (90 cm) tall, top dress instead. 
  
 How to Top Dress: 
  Remove the top 2-3 inches of soil and replace with fresh soil every couple years. Take care not to harm any roots that may be near the surface. 
  
  
 Don't prune Norfolk pine. 
  Never cut off the top or trim the sides of this plant. It doesn't need to be 
 shaped at all. You can remove any lower branches that die, using sharp pruners to prevent tearing the stems. 
 Not many house plant pests bother Norfolk pines.  
 Mealybugs 
  
 are the most common. Watch for white, cotton-like areas on leaves and stems and treat any infestation immediately. 
  
 Caring for Norfolk Pine Tree 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Norfolk Island 
 Height: 
 Up to 6 ft (1.8 m), grown in a pot indoors 
 Light: 
 Bright light with some full sun. Rotate the pot occasionally 
 in front of the window 
 to give all sides light for even growth. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist in the spring and summer, lightly moist in winter. Always use tepid water for watering your houseplants. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate room (50% relative humidity) or higher. The most efficient way to boost humidity for your tropical plants is to use a small cool-mist humidifier. Dry, yellowing needles are a sign the air is too dry. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. Norfolk Island pine doesn't like the cold, so don't expose it to temps below 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
 Soil-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Can be grown from seed, although it will take several years to reach the size of a 
 purchased plant.

 Ornamental Pepper Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Capsicum annuum 
  
 Grown for its brightly colored fruit, ornamental pepper plant is not particularly attractive until it becomes 
 loaded with ripening peppers in fall and winter. Another common name for this plant is Christmas Pepper. 
  
  
  
  
 C. annuum 
  puts on a spectacular display when covered with a bounty of colorful peppers. However, it's a one-time production. 
 You can expect ornamental peppers to produce fruit for up to 6 weeks. It will not bear fruit again and is usually treated 
 as a temporary house plant and  
 discarded when it is no longer attractive. 
 White, star-shaped flowers grow in the leaf axils in summer and early fall, followed by the real star of the show -- 
 colorful peppers. 
  
  
 They may be cone-shaped or round, depending on the variety. But the peppers all change colors as they mature -- 
 from green to yellow to orange to red. Some varieties have purple fruit that is almost black. 
 These are often sold as holiday plants for their resemblance to tree lights. Choose whatever tickles your fancy... there are many good varieties to choose from. 
 'Black Pearl' 
  (shown at left) is a popular cultivar with 
 round, dark-purple peppers that turn almost black...and 
 unusual dark foliage, making this a striking ornamental. 
 'Holiday Cheer' 
  features small, round peppers that change from yellow to purple to red. 
 'Fireball' 
  is compact with round peppers that go from cream to orange to red as they mature. 
 Pinch your plant. Pinch new growth to encourage the stems to branch out and become bushy. 
 Some like it hot. Keep this tropical native warm. Ornamental chili pepper is tender and should not be exposed to temperatures 
 below 55°F/13°C. 
 CAUTION: The peppers are edible, but most are fiery hot. The juice from them can cause painful 
 burning of the eyes and mouth. Keep plants away from small children and wash your hands thoroughly after handling 
 the peppers. 
  
 Ornamental Pepper Plant Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
  To 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, including at least 4 hours a day of direct sun. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist. Leaves will drop if soil is too wet or too dry. Water thoroughly and discard drainage. 
 Humidity: 
 Average to moderate humidity (around 50% relative humidity). 
 Keep your ornamental pepper plant away from drafts and heat vents. Hot, dry air will cause the leaves to shrivel 
 and turn brown. Dry conditions also attract  
 spider mites 
 . 
 Mist the foliage with tepid water to raise the humidity around it. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool at night, 55-60°F/13-16°C; warm during the day 70-75°F/21-24°C 
 Soil: 
 Any good potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly. Tomato fertilizer 
 works great for your peppers, too. 
 Propagation: 
  Seed. Sow seeds in spring.

 Papyrus Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Cyperus papyrus 
  
 Once used by the ancient Egyptians to make paper, papyrus plant is now cultivated as an ornamental in 
 tropical wetlands. Dwarf varieties, including 'Nanus' and 'Baby Tut' are small enough to grow as house plants.

 JacLou DL 
  
 Growing in clumps, the thin papyrus stems are topped with dark-green, grass-like rays that resemble umbrella spokes. 
 Some varieties have fountain-like feathery clusters. 
 This evergreen plant grows from thick rhizomes. Fast-growing, it's considered a weed in some countries. 
 However, it won't spread too far in a pot. 
 Papyrus flowers in late summer, when given enough sunlight. The greenish-brown flower clusters appear at the 
 crown of the rayed stems. 
 Repot in spring when the roots have filled the pot. Move up only 1 size larger. 
  
  
 Early Stationery 
  
 Ancient Egyptians used papyrus stems to make paper for writing and drawing. 
 The labor-intensive process involves stripping off the stem coverings, removing the 
 inner pulp-like fibers and slicing them into wafer-thin strips. Laid side by side, the papyrus 
 strips are moistened, pressed, then dried into a sheet. 
  
  
 Where to Buy Papyrus 
  
 Finding papyrus for sale may be a bit challenging.  
 Cyperus papyrus 
 'Nanus' and 'Baby Tut' are 
 dwarf papyrus varieties that make unusual, easy-care house plants on your windowsill. Or put them on the patio to give them the light they want. 
  
  
 Papyrus Plant Care 
  
 Origin: 
  Africa 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m); dwarf papyrus grows to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Full sunlight to low light 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist at all times. 
 Native to wetlands, this exotic-looking plant prefers wet soil so it's almost impossible to overwater. You 
 can leave the pot in a saucer filled with water, if you want. Just don't let this plant dry out. Brown tips are 
 a sign that the soil is dry. 
 It's a good idea to keep a watering can nearby so you won't forget to water! 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity) 
 Temperature: 
 Normal room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C. 
 Cyperus papyrus is not winter-hardy. Y 
 ou can move your container outdoors for the summer, if you want. But bring it 
 back in when the temperature drops below 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
 Any good potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. Only fertilize 
 when watering to avoid fertilizer burn. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide plant in spring. Or take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root them in water. 
 Papyrus plant is also easy to grow from seed.

 Parlor Palm 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Chamaedorea elegans 
  
  
  
 Parlor palm is a popular house plant and easy to care for. Although the Palmae family is large, only a few 
 make good house plants.  
 Chamaedorea elegans 
  is one of those few, adapting beautifully to average 
 indoor conditions. 
 It has elegant, green leaflets on arching fronds, giving this palm a feathery, canopy shape. 
  
  
 Given enough light, a mature plant may produce sprays of small yellow flowers on tall stalks above the foliage. 
 The flowers are followed by seeds that are rarely fertile and not worth saving, so just cut the flowers off 
 when they begin to turn brown. 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 Do not prune. Parlor palm grows from a terminal bud. Pruning this single point of growth will cause it to stop growing. However, it's fine to trim off old fronds that have turned brown. 
  
  
 Repot in spring, only when the roots have filled the pot. Always use a pot with drainage holes to prevent 
 soggy soil, which can cause root rot. If you want to cover a plain nursery pot, slip it into a  
 cachepot 
  -- a decorative planter without drainage holes. I put small river stones in the bottom of my cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Brown leaf tips 
 can be caused by dry air or tap water that contains fluoride. 
 Increase humidity around the palm, if too dry. Use distilled or rain water. 
 Black spots 
  on leaves indicate fungal disease. Cut off affected leaves and set your palm where it will get air circulation.  
 Black stems? 
  Over-watering. (See "Water" below.) 
 Yellow spots 
  on leaves may indicate a lack of nutrients (see "Fertilizer" below). Or a sign of a  
 spider mite 
  infestation, though you'll likely notice the fine webbing between stems first. Isolate any infested plant and treat it right away. 
 This is one of the few palms that grows well in low light. Its tolerance for lack of light and moderate humidity 
 make it an ideal office plant. And did you know it's good for you? P 
 arlor Palm is one of the top-rated houseplants for removing toxins such as formaldehyde and ammonia from indoor air. 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 You'll commonly find this plant labeled as  
 Neanthe bella 
 . Slow-growing, they're usually sold as young 
 plants around 1 ft (30 cm) tall. 
 Ideal for dish gardens and terrariums because they'll stay small for years and won't crowd other plants. 
  
 Parlor Palm Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico and Guatemala 
 Height: 
  Slow-growing. Fully mature plants may reach 3-4 ft (90 cm - 1.2 m). 
 Light: 
  Low light to moderately bright light. If leaves are yellowish-green, this palm may be getting too much sunlight. Parlor palms grow well under fluorescent light, making them popular office plants. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, allowing the top 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) to dry out before watering again. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent root-rot. Leaves and stems that turn black are caused by over-watering. Cut any affected black stems off at the soil level and water less often. Houseplants need less water in the winter because growth is slower. 
 Humidity: 
  
 Although this palm will tolerate dry indoor air, it will be healthier with 
 40-50% relative humidity. 
 Mist the foliage regularly or set the pot on a humidity tray, if needed. 
 I mist mine a few times a week with room-temperature water. 
 Misting also keeps its leaves clean and helps to prevent 
 spider mites 
 that may attack this plant. 
 Temperature: 
  Warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. Keep your parlor palm away from heat/AC vents and cold blasts from doors in the winter months. 
 Soil: 
  2 parts peat moss-based potting mix and 1 part sharp sand. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Needs more fertilizer than most palms. Feed monthly in spring and summer with a slow-release fertilizer specially made for indoor palms. Yellow spotted or streaked leaves are a symptom of potassium or magnesium deficiency. 
 Pale leaves 
 may indicate it's suffering from iron deficiency.  
 You can revive it quickly with a foliar fertilizer spray that includes iron. 
 Propagation: 
  Can be grown from seeds, but they are slow to germinate and grow into a good-sized plant.

 How to Grow Peacock Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Calathea makoyana 
  
 Peacock Plant is a member of the Marantaceae family of prayer plants. This is one of the showiest in the clan; treat it right and you'll watch it strut its stuff. 
  
  
  
  
 Tall, slender stems hold up the oval leaves that can grow to 12 in (30 cm) long. 
 New leaves are rolled up when they emerge and are pinkish-red on the undersides. 
 The bold, decorative markings of its thin, delicate leaves resemble a peacock's tail, lending this beautiful 
 Calathea plant its common name. They are pale green with feathered dark-green lines from the midrib 
 to the outside edges of the leaf. Asymetrical stripes add an exquisite effect. 
 You'll see them fold up at night. Just like other members of the prayer plant family, Peacock Plant folds its leaves when it's dark. 
  
 Calathea Makoyana Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Brown leaf tips 
 indicate low humidity, fluoride in water, or too much fertilizer. 
 Raise the humidity. 
 Calatheas are fussy about humidity and love to be misted. If the leaves turn 
 yellow or brown, it is likely because the air is too dry. Use every practical way to keep the relative humidity 
 above 60%, especially in winter. I recommend using a  
 humidity tray or room humidifier 
 . 
 Leaves that curl up 
  probably aren't getting enough water. Aim to keep the potting medium lightly moist, but not soggy which can cause root rot. I use a  
 moisture meter 
  for houseplants rather than guess how much water is deep in the pot. It's the only sure-fire way to know if I'm watering enough -- or too much. 
 Repot in spring. 
 Move up to a pot 1 size larger when the plant outgrows its pot. This is a good time to 
 divide large, crowded plants. Use a container with drainage holes to avoid overwatering which can lead to root rot. 
 Is Calathea makoyana poisonous? 
  No, this tropical native is non-toxic to people, cats and dogs.

 Peacock Plant Care 
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  Up to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Low to moderate light. 
 Keep this showy Calathea plant out of direct sun to avoid dulling the colors of the leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep mix evenly moist at all times, but not soggy. Use distilled or rain water because Peacock Plant is sensitive to fluoride and 
 other chemicals in many public water supplies. 
 Humidity: 
 Requires moist air (aim to maintain 60% relative humidity around the plant). Set pot on a tray of wet pebbles and mist leaves frequently with room- 
 temperature water. If indoor air is extremely dry during the winter months, it's a good idea to use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm room temperatures 70-85°F/21-29°C 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly with a balanced house plant fertilizer diluted by half spring through fall. 
 Do not feed in winter. New leaves that are lighter in color aren't getting enough nitrogen or iron. If your 
 fertilizer doesn't contain these nutrients, use a foliar spray that lists these nutrients on the bottle. You 
 should see an improvement within a few weeks. 
 Propagation: 
 Division. Calathea plant is not easy to divide, so divide the plant in spring 
 only when it gets quite large.

 Peperomia Caperata 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Peperomia caperata 
  
 A member of the Piperaceae family, this compact plant has short stems covered by heart-shaped, deeply ridged leaves.  
 The leaves are green, sometimes with a blush of red, and dark green veins. 
 If your 
  
 P. caperata 
  
 doesn't look like this one, there's good reason. Newer cultivars give this popular houseplant a whole new look. Some of the varieties are listed below. 
 In summer through early fall, you may see slender flower spikes. They rise tall above the mound of foliage, growing from the base of the plant with reddish-purple stems. Whether you like the "flowers" or not...they are one of the hallmarks of  
 Peperomia caperata 
 . 
  
  
  
 Peperomia caperata has unusual flowers -- an abundance of tall, slender spikes. 
  
 Peperomia Caperata Varieties 
  
 The most common cultivar is 'Emerald Ripple' with a compact growing habit... 'Variegata' has white leaves 
 with a splash of green. Some have reddish-green leaves, such as 'Burgundy'. Another favorite is 'Rosso' with smooth, shiny, quilted foliage. 
 Choose a plant with the leaf colors and patterns that you like. They're all easy to grow. 
  
 Peperomia Caperata 'Rosso' is stunning with shiny, green and burgundy leaves. 
  
 Peperomia Caperata Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Peperomia caperata 
  is usually trouble-free. 
 The only thing that really bothers this plant is soggy soil. 
  
 Don't overwater 
 . Allow the soil to dry out slightly between 
 waterings. Water sparingly in winter, when growth is slower. Wilting leaves is 
 likely because drainage is poor and its roots are not getting enough oxygen. 
 Black stems and lower leaves 
  are a symptom of soggy soil. If only a few stems turn black, they can be cut off at the base. Ease the plant out of its pot and take a peek at its roots. Are they black and mushy? If so, the plant likely won't recover...toss it out. 
 Repot in spring 
 , only when the plant has outgrown its pot. Move it into a pot that's only slightly larger, because a container 
 that's too big will hold too much water and may cause root rot. Also, be sure to use a container with a drainage hole. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, slip it into a cachepot (a decorative planter without drainage holes). I put small river stones in the bottom of my cachepots to keep the pot above the drainage water. 
 Leaf drop 
 may be caused by a build-up of salts in the soil from soft water or too much fertilizer. You can see 
 accumulated salts as a white crusty deposits on the surface of the soil. Fortunately, it's easy to flush out excess salts. 
  
 How to flush out salts: 
 Pour plenty of room-temperature water over the soil, drenching 
 the soil and allowing the excess water to drain out of the drainage holes for several minutes. 
 Then pour more water. Empty the drainage tray. 
  
  
 Are Peperomias poisonous? 
  No -- they are safe to grow in a home with pets. They are non-toxic to cats, dogs and people. 
  
 Its textured leaves and low-growing mound of foliage make it an ideal addition to a dish garden or 
 a  
 terrarium 
 . And it loves the humidity. 
  
 Peperomia Caperata Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
 8 in (20 cm) 
 Light: 
 Low to bright light. 
 Protect this plant from direct sunlight. Light from an east- or north-facing window works best. 
 Peperomia caperata 
  thrives under  
 indoor grow lights 
 ,  
 making it a good choice for an office plant. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil barely moist. Allow the top inch of soil to dry between waterings. Water less in winter, allowing the top 
 half of the soil to dry out before watering again. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate -- around 40-50% relative humidity. Use a  
 humidity tray or room humidifier 
 , if needed. Or put your plant in an open terrarium -- it thrives in the moist air like its native rain forest habitat. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C) year-round. 
 Soil: 
 Light peat moss potting mix that contains perlite or sand to help drainage.  
 Peperomia 
  likes some air around its roots. This plant will easily get stem and/or root rot if the potting medium is kept wet. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half. Stop feeding in winter, when growth is slow. 
 Propagation: 
 Take leaf or stem tip cuttings in spring.

 Persian Shield Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Strobilanthes dyerianus 
  
  
  
  
 Persian Shield is a stunning house plant that's a cinch to grow with minimal attention. Its colorful, shimmery leaves are every bit as attention-getting as most flowering plants, plus it's easy to please. 
 Those lance-shaped leaves are deep purple and green with a shimmer of silver. Expect the colors to lighten as the plant ages, but this isn't a problem. Pinch off a stem anytime to grow a new plant. Keep pinching and you'll have a succession of new house plants. This is a plant that keeps on giving. 
  
 Iridescent leaves make Persian Shield a standout among your plant collection. 
  
 You may see light-blue flowers appear in summer, but they pale in comparison to the magnificent foliage. Pinch off 
 the flower spikes as soon as you see them because they weaken the plant. Those beautiful metallic leaves are the 
 real attraction, anyway. 
 This soft-stemmed shrub is fast-growing. Cut Persian Shield back in spring when it becomes leggy. Pinching 
 off its stem tips in spring and summer will encourage branching and create a fuller, bushier plant. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Cut a stem at an angle, just after a node 
 (the place where a leaf is attached to the stem). Cutting here will force the stem to branch out. 
  
  
 Brown crispy leaves 
 are caused by dry air. This tropical native wants moist air to look its best. 
 Take a look at these easy ways to  
 raise the humidity 
  
 around it. 
 Repot in spring 
 when the roots have filled the pot -- probably every couple years. 
 Make more plants 
 . 
 This beautiful plant will get leggy over time. 
 By propagating stem cuttings -- which is easy to do -- you can replace the plant 
 and keep it going indefinitely. 
  
 Persian Shield Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Burma (officially, the Union of Myanmar) 
 Height: 
 Up to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly and allow the soil to dry out a bit between waterings. Keep soil drier in winter months, but 
 do not allow it to dry out completely. Use distilled water because tap water often contains chlorine, which leaves white spots on the foliage. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate room (about 40-50% relative humidity -- or higher). The most efficient way to boost moisture for indoor plants is with a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Normal room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C. 
 Strobilanthes dyerianus 
  is a tender perennial. 
 Hardy only in Zone 10, so if it summers outdoors,  
 bring it back in if the temperature drops below 60°F/16°C at night. 
 Soil: 
 Any good potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. Only fertilize 
 when watering to avoid fertilizer burn. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root them in moist soil. Propagating  
 the cuttings requires a  
 heat mat 
  for best results. 
 Cuttings should root in about 2-3 weeks.

 Philodendron 'Prince of Orange' 
  
  
  
 Vibrant orange leaves unfurl from Philodendron 'Prince of Orange' -- a stunning hybrid from an easy-care family of plants. 
 New orange foliage changes to light green as the plant matures. You can help this philodendron to grow colorful new leaves by giving it plenty of indirect sunlight. 
  
  
  
  
 Unlike its tree-dwelling relatives, this eye-catching philodendron hybrid won't climb. It is a clump-forming plant growing from a ground-hugging rosette. Short, upright stems carry large, thick leaves. It will reach about 2-ft tall and spread about as wide. The good news is that Philodendron 'Prince of Orange' won't need staking. But if it gets too leggy, you can cut off some of the stems to keep the plant in shape. 
 Keep those leaves dust-free by gently wiping them with a soft, damp cloth. 
  
 Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Wondering when to repot? 
  
 Move young plants to a pot 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger every year or two. Don't overpot -- a common mistake with houseplants. Why? A too-big container will hold too much water, which may cause root rot. It is best to use a pot with drainage holes so you can water thoroughly without drowning your plant. 
 Want to use a decorative container without drainage holes? Use it as a  
 cachepot 
  -- just slip the plain nursery pot into the cachepot to cover it up. I put small rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Here are the steps to 
 repotting houseplants 
 . 
  
 Something bugging your plant? 
  
 New leaves that are yellow speckled and crinkled are a sign of  
 aphids 
 . These sap-sucking insects attack soft, new growth on plants. Rinse off the leaves with tepid water, then treat your plant with insecticidal soap. Philodendrons seem to shrug off aphids once they've been treated. Aphids usually only attack plants that have been outdoors. 
 Peaty potting mixes that are kept wet may attract  
 fungus gnats 
 . They are difficult to spot because they are black and crawl on the soil. These are more common indoors; and fortunately, easier to eliminate. 
  
 Is this Philodendron poisonous? 
  
 Yes, all parts of the plant are toxic and the sap can cause skin irritation. Keep the plant out of the reach of children, cats and dogs. 
  
 Philodendron 'Prince of Orange' Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
 Manmade hybrid of Philodendron spp. from Central and South America 
 Height: 
 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Although Philodendron 'Prince of Orange' will tolerate lower light levels, its l 
 eaves will maintain their color better in bright light. 
 Keep your philodendron plant in a bright location, but not into direct sunlight which can scorch its leaves. It thrives under  
 fluorescent light 
 , too, making it an ideal office plant. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, then allow surface to dry out before watering again. Water sparingly in winter, when growth is slower, but don't allow potting medium to dry out. Yellow leaves 
 are often caused by over-watering. Never allow the potting medium to become soggy, which can suffocate roots, leading to root rot; roots need air, too. Remember to always use tepid water for your houseplants because cold water is a shock to these warmth-loving tropicals. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 50% relative humidity or higher. Indoor air can become extremely dry in the winter. It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge, rather than guess. The most efficient way to boost indoor humidity for tropical plants is to set a cool-mist room humidifier near your plant. Brown leaf tips are a symptom of dry air. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm room temperatures (70-85°F/21-29°C) year-round. Keep this tropical plant from cold blasts from windows and doorways, and away from heat/AC vents. It will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based mix with added perlite or vermiculite for good drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed Philodendron 'Prince of Orange' monthly spring through fall with a balanced liquid or water-soluble houseplant fertilizer. Feed every 2 months in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
 Can be grown from stem cuttings in spring.

 Care for Piggyback Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Tolmiea menziesii 
 In its native habitat, piggyback plant grows as a groundcover in the shady woodland forests along the 
 northern Pacific coastline. Give it a cool spot with high humidity 
 and you'll find it's easy to grow. 
  
  
  
  
 The lush, green, hairy leaves on this evergreen are mapleleaf-shaped with scalloped edges. Decorative leaf 
 patterns form an eye-catching mound of foliage. But the captivating feature is the way it makes new plants. Mature leaves 
 grow new plantlets from the top of its  
 petioles 
 (the place where the leaf attaches to the stem). 
 This unusual growth habit lends the common names, piggyback plant, youth-on-age and thousand mothers. 
 Plantlets weigh down the stems, giving this plant a trailing habit. Show off 
 its trailing, piggyback leaves by planting it in a hanging basket. 
 Will it bloom? Spikes of tubular flowers sometimes appear in summer, but rarely on plants grown indoors. 
 Piggyback plant is in the Saxifragaceae family, along with Strawberry Begonia. 
 What these two have in common besides attractive foliage is a trailing habit 
 and their ability to produce plantlets that are easily propagated. 
 Is piggyback plant poisonous? 
 No. According to the ASPCA, 
 Tolmiea menziesii  
 is non-toxic to cats and dogs. 
 A few varieties are available.  
 'Variegata' 
 is mottled with creamy yellow.  
 'Taff's Gold' 
  
 is a popular variety heavily splashed with yellow. 
  
 Growing Tips for Piggyback Plant 
  
 Repot in spring 
  every couple years or when the roots fill the pot. Its creeping roots spread 
 so use a wide pot. Just be sure to use one with drainage holes to prevent overwatering. 
 The hairs on the leaves and stems can cause minor skin irritation. It's a good idea to wear gloves when repotting 
 . 
 Brown, crispy leaves? 
  Dry-looking foliage can be caused by a few things: 
  
 Direct sun can cause brown scorch marks on the leaves. Keep plant out of strong summer sun. 
 Low humidity is likely the culprit. Crispy, shriveled leaves are a sign that the air is too dry. Mist with water, use a pebble tray or a room humidifier to  
 raise the humidity 
  around the plant. High temperatures can send the humidity plummeting, so daily misting may be needed in the summer. 
 Dry soil could also cause dry leaves. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist. 
  
 Pinch your plant 
  back to keep it from getting leggy. Giving it bright light will help it to grow 
 lush and full. 
  
 Piggyback Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  West Coast of North America (From Alaska to Northern California) 
 Height: 
  Up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Moderate to bright light, but no direct sun. Pale leaves and long spaces between leaves indicate the plant is not getting enough sunlight. 
 Water: 
  Water regularly throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist, but not soggy. 
 Water less in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Humidity: 
  Aim to maintain at least 50% relative humidity around the plant. Mist foliage with room-temperature water or use a pebble tray 
 to  
 raise humidity 
 . Brown leaf tips are a sign that the air is too dry. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool to average (50-75°F/10-24°C) 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take leaf cuttings with plantlets and set them in a pot, allowing the base of the 
 plantlets to touch the soil. Roots will form quickly from this junction. After the parent leaf has dried 
 up, cut it away from the newly rooted plantlet.

 Carnivorous Pitcher Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Nepenthes 
 species and hybrids 
 Pitcher Plant care is easy -- or difficult -- depending on the growing conditions you have available.

 Year-Round Pitcher Plant Care 
  
 Unlike many carnivorous plants that come from bogs and swamps and prefer wet, cool conditions, 
 Nepenthes 
 prefers tropical warmth and humidity. So unless you happen to live in the tropics, this 
 epiphytic carnivore will need special accommodations. 
 A heated sunroom or greenhouse, where the air is consistently warm and humid is the best place for your 
 pitcher plant. Just keep it shaded from direct sunlight at all times. Put it in a hanging basket to show off 
 those unusual and fascinating pitchers. 
 The glossy green leaves grow to 1 ft (30 cm) long and feature a tendril at the tip. Large, pendulous pitchers commonly 
 grow at the tips of those tendrils and are topped with a lid to keep out the rain. Depending on the species or hybrid, 
 the pitchers may be yellow-green or mid-green and splashed or spotted with purple or red. 
 About those bug-eating pitchers... 
 Because this epiphytic carnivorous plant is unable to get the nutrients it needs from soil, it 
 has developed a 
 way to attract, capture and ingest insects. Bugs are lured inside its pitchers with an intoxicating nectar. 
 Once inside, the insects fall into the pepsin liquid where they drown and are digested. 
 Repot in spring 
 only when needed. Handle the roots carefully because they're delicate and break easily. 
 Plant  
 Nepenthes 
 in a basket with drainage holes to prevent soggy medium, 
 which can cause root rot. 
 Prune it back 
 in spring to keep  
 Nepenthes 
  a reasonable size. Older plants can be cut back harshly. 
 Pruning encourages new growth so you'll get a fuller plant.

 Pitcher Plant Buying Tips 
  
 Some popular Malaysian pitcher plants include: 
 Nepenthes 'Alata' 
 , one of the most common species cultivated, has pitchers heavily marbled with red. 
 Nepenthes x coccinea 
 , featuring yellow and red pitchers. 
 Nepenthes 'Superba' 
 , a vigorous grower with yellow-green pitchers splotched 
 with dark crimson. 
 Nepenthes x hookeriana 
 with large, pale-green pitchers marbled with red. 
  
 Pitcher Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Borneo and Malaysia 
 Height: 
 Climbs or trails to 10 ft (3 m) 
 Light: 
 Moderate to bright light, but no direct sun. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist year-round, but not soggy which can cause root-rot. Because this plant is sensitive to chemicals in tap water, use only 
 distilled or lime-free rain water. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (50-80% relative humidity) is a must for pitcher plant care. Mist the plant every 
 day or use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . Pitcher plants grow best in a heated greenhouse. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 75-85°F/24-29°C. It will tolerate a minimum of 65°F/18°C. 
 Soil: 
 Use a nutrient-poor medium because rich potting mix will harm its roots. You can plant it in live sphagnum moss, or 
 if that is not available, mix 1 part peat moss with 1 part perlite or horticultural sand. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Don't fertilize the plant. In spring and fall, drop a few insects into the pitchers occasionally 
 if there are none flying around. Don't use bugs that have been treated with insecticide. 
 Propagation: 
 Take leaf cuttings in spring and root them in sphagnum moss. Use a 
 heat mat 
 . Mist every day with tepid water to 
 keep the medium moist. Be patient -- rooting can take up to 8 weeks.

 Pleomele - Dracaena Reflexa 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Dracaena reflexa 
 Commonly known as Pleomele or Song of India, this is one of the more decorative 
 types of Dracaena that is grown indoors. 
 Whorls of yellow-banded green leaves spiral upright, reaching about 3 ft (90 cm) tall. Its compact 
 form and slow growth make it an ideal room accent. 
 Give a young plant a boost by placing it on a 
  
 pedestal plant stand 
 . 
 Those upright rosettes of colorful leaves will look spectacular. 
  
  
  
  
 Care is easy. This Dracaena thrives in average room conditions, even tolerating dry indoor air. It 
 will survive in low light, but you'll get the best leaf color and growth by keeping this tropical in bright light 
 year-round. Just don't overwater. Soggy soil will cause stems to become soft and mushy at the soil level. 
 Upright leaves tend to be dust-catchers. Set your plant in the shower and gently spray the leaves with tepid water. Or wipe them off with a damp cloth. 
  
 Repot in spring when roots become coiled in the container or grow out of the drainage holes. Use a pot only 1-2 inches (5-8 cm) larger than the old pot because a pot that's too big will hold too much water. Always use fresh potting mix 
 when you repot a plant. 
 Dracaena reflexa 
  even shrugs off pests, although dry air may attract  
 spider mites 
  
 to its leaves. Regular misting with water will do double-duty, raising the humidity and keeping those pests away. 
  
 Dracaena Reflexa Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar and other islands in the Indian Ocean 
 Height: 
  To 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect sunlight. You'll get the best leaf color in bright light, but keep the plant out of direct sunlight which can cause brown scorch marks on leaves. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall, slightly drier in winter. Do not let soil get waterlogged, which can cause root rot. Dracaenas are sensitive to fluoride, often added to tap water. Use distilled or rainwater. Always use room-temperature water for your indoor plants. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Dry air may cause leaf tips to turn brown; there are easy ways to  
 raise the humidity 
  for house plants. 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temps (65-75°F/18-24°C) will suit this plant. It tolerates hot better than cold; do not expose it to temperatures below 
 50°F/10°C. Even cold drafts near a door or window will harm it. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-4 inch (8-10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring. Pot 3 in the same container for a fuller effect. 
 Cuttings are easy to root in moist sterile potting mix.

 Polka Dot Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Hypoestes phyllostachya 
 Splattered leaves make Polka Dot Plant an unusual and attractive house plant. Many are pink, however newer hybrids are available with red or white spotted leaves.

 This bushy plant grows quickly with good light. Pinch back growing tips often to encourage branching and to keep the plant compact. 
 Insignificant purple flower spikes may appear. Pinch them off because they detract from the foliage and can cause the plant to deteriorate after blooming. 
 Shed some light. 
  Leaves may revert to solid-green in low light. Put Polka Dot Plant where it'll get plenty of light, 
 but out of direct sun. Filtered light from a south- or west-facing window will give it the light it needs. If you move 
 your plant outdoors for the summer, keep it fully shaded from hot sun, which can cause leaves to curl up and develop brown 
 scorch marks. 
 Keep up the humidity. 
 If relative humidity drops below 50%, use a humidity tray or room humidifier 
 to increase the moisture in the air. Grouping plants also helps to maintain the humidity around them. A terrarium  
 is an ideal home for this humidity-loving plant, where it will add eye-catching color among green foliage plants. 
 Water regularly. 
  Keep the soil lightly moist, but take care not to overwater. Too-dry soil will cause leaves to wilt and 
 drop off. Quickly revive a wilted plant with a thorough watering. Soggy soil will cause the leaves to turn yellow. 
 Pinch your plant. 
 Pinch off tall stems to prevent the plant from getting too leggy. Also, pinch off 
 growing tips to encourage stems to branch out for a fuller, bushier plant.

 Polka Dot Plant Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Curled-up leaves 
  are typically the symptom of too much sun.  
 Hypoestes phyllostachya 
  needs bright, indirect light to maintain its color, but keep it out of hot, direct sunlight. 
 Wondering when to repot? 
  New plants can be moved to slightly larger pots right away. Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. If you want to use a  
 cachepot 
  -- a decorative container without drainage holes -- set the nursery pot in the cachepot. I put small river stones in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. You can repot older plants in spring or summer when they outgrow their containers. Here's how to know  
 when to repot and how to do it 
 . 
 Dropped leaves 
  are caused by dry soil. This Madagascar native likes consistent watering, but not soggy soil. Over-watering may cause  
 yellow leaves that fall off 
 . Always use a container with drainage holes so you can water thoroughly without worry of drowning your plant. If you think you've hopelessly over-watered, repot it right away in fresh soil. 
 Webbing between stems and leaves 
  are a tell-tale sign of  
 spider mites 
 . These tiny pests can do a lot of damage to plants and are not easy to get rid of. Spider mites are attracted to houseplants in the winter, when indoor air is dry; you can help to prevent them by boosting humidity around your plant. Cut off any badly infested stems and wash off your plant with room-temperature water. 
 Is  
 Hypoestes phyllostachya 
  poisonous? 
  No -- it's not toxic to people or pets. 
  
 Polka Dot Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
 Madagascar 
 Height: 
  Keep to about 10 in (25 cm) by pinching off. 
 Light: 
  
 Polka Dot Plant will lose its variegation in low light. 
 Give your plant plenty of bright, indirect light for sensational color. P 
 rotect plants from direct sun to prevent scorching leaves. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly, evenly moist spring through fall, and slightly drier in winter when growth is slower. 
 Humidity: 
  This tropical native wants higher humidity than most homes provide. Try to maintain 50% relative humidity around the plant. This is easier than it seems. Use a cool-mist room humidifier or humidity tray. Check out these easy ways to  
 raise the humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced liquid or water-soluble fertilizer mixed at half the regular strength. 
 Propagation: 
  Grows easily from seeds. Take stem cuttings in spring and early summer.

 Golden Pothos or Devil's Ivy 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Epipremnum aureum 
  
  
  
  
  
 Extremely easy to grow, pothos is a popular house plant well known for its long, trailing stems that can grow to 8 ft (2.4 m) or more. 
 Cut stems back a couple times a year to keep the plant bushy and full. Cutting right after a leaf node (the place where 
 the leaf is attached to the stem) will encourage the stem to branch out, giving you a fuller plant. 
 Glossy, heart-shaped leaves emerge green and become variegated with yellow or white. Although this plant tolerates low light well, 
 its leaves may lose their variegation. Pothos will look its best in moderate or bright light. It makes an excellent office plant because 
 it grows well under  
 fluorescent lights 
 . 
  
 Air-Cleaning Plant 
  
 Pothos is one of the best plants for removing formaldehyde in the air that comes from carpet and other materials in our homes. Beautiful, low-maintenance, and cleans the air. What's not to love? 
  
  
 Show off those beautiful trailing stems in a  
 hanging planter 
 . 
 Or you can train it to climb. A tree-climber in its native tropical habitat, 
 Epipremnum aureum 
  
 has aerial roots that can be trained to climb a moss stick or  
 trellis 
 . 
 Use florist wire to hold the vines in place while they grow and wrap themselves around the support. 
 Repot in spring as needed. You can control its growth by cutting the vines back and trimming up to a third of its roots. 
 Pot it in the same size container if you want to keep it small. 
 Is pothos poisonous? Yes. This plant contains calcium oxalates, which is toxic to cats and dogs. If eaten, it can cause severe burning of the mouth, tongue and lips, excessive drooling, vomiting and difficulty swallowing. If your pet has eaten 
 Epipremnum aureum 
  and shows any signs of illness, contact your veterinarian immediately. 
  
  
 Pothos Problems and Cures 
  
 Leaves are mostly green. 
  Leaves will lose their variegation when they don't get enough light. Keep your plant where it will be exposed to bright, indirect sunlight. If your plant is unfurling new leaves that are solid green, don't worry. That's normal -- they'll become variegated as they age. 
 Stems are leggy with few leaves. 
 Stems that are allowed to grow longer than 4 ft (1.2 m) often shed most of their leaves near the base of the plant. It's a good idea to trim off long stems once in a while to keep pothos leafy and full. Stems that are mostly bare can be cut off at the soil level. 
 Wilted leaves. 
  Wilting is caused by dry soil. Although this plant will quickly bounce back after a good drink, water regularly. 
 Yellow leaves and/or stems. 
  Overwatering is about the only thing that will kill  
 Epipremnum aureum 
 . Allow soil to dry out a bit between waterings. Are the stems yellow and mushy? That's a symptom of root rot. Your plant may be too far gone. If any of the stems are still green and healthy, propagate stem cuttings for new plants and discard the dying plant and soggy soil. 
 Fungus gnats 
  love wet peaty potting mixes. Look for these tiny black fly-like insects crawling on the soil. Find out how to  
 get rid of fungus gnats 
  here. 
  
 Epipremnum Aureum 
  Buying Tips 
  
 Choose a plant based on your preference because they're all easy to grow. 
 'Golden Pothos' (shown at bottom) is a popular cultivar variegated with yellow. 
 'Marble Queen' is handsomely splashed with white and 'Neon' has bright yellow-green leaves. 
  
  
  
 Pothos Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Solomon Islands 
 Height: 
  To 8 ft (2.4 m) or longer 
 Light: 
 Low light to bright light. No direct sun, which will burn foliage. Although pothos will tolerate low light, it will have more 
 leaves and better variegation if kept in bright light. Long spaces between leaves indicate pothos is not getting enough sunlight. This plant thrives under fluorescent light, making it an ideal office plant. 
 Water: 
  
 Allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry between waterings. 
  
 Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil. 
  
 Overwatering will cause leaves to turn yellow and fall off. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity) or higher. Brown leaf tips are caused by dry air. Discover easy ways to  
 raise the humidity 
  for your house plants. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. In winter, feed monthly. 
 Propagation: 
  Stem tip cuttings root easily in water or moist perlite or vermiculite. Cut a 4-6-inch stem tip with a couple leaves attached. Cut just below a node (a place where a leaf is attached to the stem) because the node contains cells that will grow roots. It takes at least 4 weeks to root.

 Prayer Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Maranta leuconeura 
  
 Prayer Plant earned its name because of the way its leaves fold together at night, like hands closed in prayer. 
 Its leaves unfold in the morning light, sometimes making a rustling sound.  
 Cool, huh? 
  
 Showy, oval-shaped leaves have a spectacular light-and-dark-green feathered pattern with red veins, and are often 
 red underneath. Its leaves grow to about 5 in (12 cm) long. 
  
  
  
 Beautifully patterned foliage are the hallmark of this popular prayer plant. 
  
 Prayer plants rarely bloom indoors, but sometimes grow tiny, white tubular flowers on long stems. The flowers 
 are insignificant, anyway. It's the magnificent leaves that are really the attraction. 
 There are a few named varieties. 
 One of the most popular is 'Erythroneura', pictured here. It's 
 sometimes called herringbone plant because of the pattern of its prominant red leaf veins and dark-green and yellow-green leaves. 
 You may find it for sale as 'Tricolor'. 
 'Massangeana' is also striking with black-green leaves and silver veins.

 Caring for Prayer Plant 
  
 Give it a rest. 
 You can expect your plant to take a "rest" in winter and growth will slow down. Water lightly during this time 
 and stop fertilizing, but maintain humidity. You'll see a flush of colorful, new leaves appear in spring and summer. 
 Prune it. 
  Your plant will benefit from occasional pruning, which 
 helps to give it a nice shape and promote new growth. Fall is the best time to cut it back. 
 Use sharp pruners to cut away some of the older leaves. 
 Give it good care and it will live for many years. This tropical plant prefers a warm, humid environment and 
 well-aerated soil. To prevent the soil from becoming too compact, 
 repot it every spring. 
  Do not 
 pack the soil tightly around the roots -- keep it loose. You can choose a shallow pot for your prayer plant. Its 
 shallow root system doesn't need much room. 
 Watch for  
 spider mites 
 . Dry indoor air in 
 the winter months encourages these pests to invade house plants, another reason to keep the humidity up. You'll 
 first notice webbing between stems and on the undersides of leaves. 
 Clean leaves. 
 Gently wipe leaves with a soft, dry cloth to keep them dust-free.

 Prayer Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  Up to 12 inches (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Prayer plants grow best with bright, indirect light 
 from an east- or north-facing window. 
 It also grows well under fluorescent light. 
 Keep plant out of direct sun; strong sunlight will cause the leaves to fade. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist spring through summer, slightly drier in winter. 
 Humidity: 
  Requires moist air. Brown leaf tips are a sign that the air is too dry. Try to maintain at least 50% relative humidity year-round. It's a good idea 
 to use a  
 humidity tray or a cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round 
 Soil: 
  Peat-rich potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed with a water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half every 2 weeks spring through fall. 
 Propagation: 
  In spring, take 4-inch (10 cm) stem cuttings with 3-4 leaves attached. Root them in moist potting mix. 
 When your plant gets too big, you can easily divide it in half by pulling apart its shallow roots.

 Tradescantia pallida - Purple Heart Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Tradescantia pallida 
  
 If you've never grown Purple Heart Plant, you may want to 
 add it to your collection. It's in the spiderwort family along with the Wandering Jew plant, and you'll find it's just as easy to grow. 
 T. pallida 
  is also known as  
 Setcreasea purpurea 
 . 
  
  
  
 Bunches of rich purple, lance-shaped leaves make this a beautiful house plant year-round. Pot Purple Heart Plant in a small decorative container for an eye-catching table accent. Or hang it in a basket and let the long, sprawling stems cascade over the side. 
  
  
 You'll want to handle this plant carefully; its fleshy stems are brittle and may break off. It's a good idea to place Purple Heart Plant where you won't brush against it. 
 In summer, you can expect small, pink 3-petaled flowers to bloom. They grow in the leaf axils, making 
 a stunning contrast to the dark foliage. 
 You can keep your plant indoors year-round. But if you move it outdoors for the summer, keep it 
 shaded from direct sun during the hottest part of the day. 
 Also check the soil every couple days so that it doesn't dry out. 
  
 Growing  
 Tradescantia pallida 
  Indoors 
  
 Let the sun shine in. 
 Grow your plant in bright light year-round for good foliage color. It will grow in 
 lower light, but the leaves will be more green than purple. Give it some direct sun, but 
 shade it from hot, noonday sun in summer to avoid scorching its leaves. 
 Pinch your plant. 
 Pinching off new stem tips will promote branching and keep  
 Tradescantia pallida  
 compact.  
 Don't 
 toss out those cuttings 
 -- you can easily propagate them for more plants. If your plant becomes straggly with long gaps between leaves, don't be afraid to prune stems back to about 6 in (15 cm) long. 
 Repot in spring 
 , when you see roots growing through the drainage holes. 
 Move up to a pot only 1 or 2 inches (2.5 - 5 cm) larger to give it a little 
 room to grow. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which leads to root rot. Want to use a decorative planter without drainage holes? Use it as a  
 cachepot 
  -- just slip a plain nursery pot into the cachepot. I put pebbles in the bottom of cachepots to keep the pot above the drainage water. 
  
 Tradescantia Pallida for Sale 
  
  
 T. pallida 
 is also known as 
 Setcreasea purpurea 
 and is sometimes sold under that name. 
  
  
  
 Tradescantia Pallida Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico 
 Height: 
  Stems grow upright, then eventually trail over the side of the pot, up to 2 ft (60 cm) long. 
 Light: 
  Bright light is needed to maintain the dark purple color. Some direct sun is fine, but keep your plant shaded from strong summer sun. Long spaces between leaves indicate  
 Tradescantia pallida 
  needs more sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, then allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings. Water less in winter when growth is slower. Limp, wilted stems may be a sign of root rot; cut off entire stem at the soil level. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Brown leaf tips are a symptom of dry air. Check out these easy ways to  
 add humidity around your houseplants 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) suit this plant year-round.  
 Purple heart tolerates varying temperatures with a minimum of 50°F/10°C in winter. Keep out of drafts from doorways and away from heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix, such as African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. They'll root easily in 
 moist potting mix.

 Purple Passion Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Gynura aurantiaca 
  
 Purple Passion Plant is known for its finely serrated green leaves, densely covered with purple 
 hairs. The leaf undersides and stems are also hairy, giving the whole plant an iridescent, velvety sheen. 
  
  
  
 Shimmery, velvet leaves make this tropical plant a captivating houseplant. 
  
 Pinch off the yellow-orange flowers that appear in spring. They're not only ugly, they have a bad 
 odor. Plants often flower after they're a year old. You may notice that your plant will begin 
 to decline after flowering. That's why it's a good idea to propagate cuttings to replace your plant. It's 
 fast-growing, so you'll have a big, lush-looking new house plant in no time. 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 Careful with that water! Avoid getting the velvety leaves wet. Drops of water will cause dark spots on the leaves and they won't come off. 
 If the leaves need to be cleaned, brush them gently with a soft, dry brush, such as a small paintbrush. 
  
  
 Shed some light. 
 Providing bright light will enhance the color of this stunning foliage plant. 
 If the leaves are more green than purple, move the plant to a sunnier spot. Keep it out of harsh, 
 direct sunlight, though, because its leaves will scorch. 
 Pinch it back. 
 Pinching off the stem tips is the way to make it branch out for a fuller, bushier 
 plant. Don't toss out those stem tip cuttings, either. They'll root easily, giving you more beautiful plants. 
 Water regularly. 
 Purple Passion Plant is a "fainter" if the soil is allowed to dry out. However, you 
 can revive it quickly with a thorough watering. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist during the growing season, 
 slightly drier in winter. 
 This popular plant may be labeled by any of these common names: Purple Passion Plant, Purple Passion Vine or 
 Velvet Plant. Some have an upright growing habit, others are vining. 
 If you're looking for an upright form of Purple Passion, look for 
 Gynura aurantiaca 
 . 
 Want the trailing vine type for a hanging basket? 
 Gynura sarmentosa 
 has twining stems that can be trained 
 to grow up a trellis or left to trail. 
  
 Purple Passion Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Indonesia 
 Height: 
 Upright forms grow to 2 ft (60 cm) tall. Trailing forms can grow to 4 ft (1.2 m) long. 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light. Some direct morning sun is fine, but avoid strong summer sun which can 
 scorch its leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist spring through fall. 
 Gynura aurantiaca 
 will wilt when the potting mix dries out. 
 Water less in winter, keeping the plant 
 barely moist. When watering, take care not to get water drops on the leaves which can damage them. 
 Humidity: 
 This tropical native likes moist air. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a  
 pebble tray or humidifier 
 . 
 Don't mist this plant because the hairs trap moisture that may cause the leaves to rot. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based mix, such as African violet potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Feed monthly in winter when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3-4 in (7.5-10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. Cut just below a 
 node 
  -- the place where a leaf is attached to a stem. Dip cut ends in  
 hormone rooting powder 
  and place 
 in moist peat moss or perlite. Enclose in a clear, plastic bag or  
 cloche  
 for the first couple weeks to hold in moisture.

 Purple Pitcher Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Sarracenia purpurea 
  
 Purple Pitcher Plant is native to swampy, humid regions of North America and is an unusual carnivorous plant you can grow indoors. 
  
  
  
 Sun exposure causes red-purple veining. Photo: Sonja Kalee 
  
 Upright leaves are tubular, the tops slightly bent over like a hood. These "pitchers" contain sweet juices that lure 
 insects. Once an insect is inside, it is unable to escape the slippery slope and is digested by the plant's juices. 
 Pitcher colors and shapes vary by subspecies.  
 S.p. venosa 
 has dark purplish-red pitchers and bright green hoods 
 with prominent purplish-red veins.  
 S.p. purpurea 
 is mostly purplish red with some green on the inside. 
 Mature plants will send up flowers in summer. And they are spectacular -- nodding umbrellas rising above the pitchers on tall stems. Flowers are made up of 5 petals and 5 sepals and may reach up to 3 inches (7 cm) wide. Bloom colors vary by subspecies and may be dark red, purple or pink. 
  
 Caring for Purple Pitcher Plants Year-Round 
  
 No blooms? 
 If you bought a young plant at the store, you won't see flowers on it for a few years. Be patient. 
 Repot 
 only when pitchers become too crowded. Use a wide pot to make room for growth. 
 Because of its unquenchable thirst, it's a good idea to pot 
 Sarracenia purpurea 
 in a shallow pot with drainage holes 
 and place it in a saucer. Go ahead and water from the top, allowing the water to flow through the pot. You won't 
 need to empty the saucer -- Purple Pitcher Plant will drink that up, too. 
 Winter care. 
 Purple Pitchers may go dormant in winter. Water just enough to keep the potting medium barely moist, but don't allow it to dry out completely. Cooler winter temps will suit them, but do not expose Keep them in bright light/direct sun year-round. 
  
  
 Purple Pitcher Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  East Coast of the US and Southeastern Canada 
 Height: 
 Leaves 6-in (15 cm); Flowers up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 Purple Pitchers thrive in bright locations with some direct sun. Sunlight will deepen the red/purple color of their leaves. 
 Water: 
 Water generously throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist. 
 Use rainwater or distilled water because the chemicals and minerals found in tap water will harm the plant. Never allow 
 the potting mixture to dry out. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (above 50% relative humidity). Set the plant on a  
 humidity tray 
 to raise the moisture around it. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average room temperatures 60-70°F/16-21°C. Sarracenias will tolerate a minimum of 40°F/4°C 
 in winter.  
 Soil: 
  Sarracenia purpurea needs a medium that's free of nutrients and allows good drainage. Use a mixture of 1 part sphagnum peat moss and 
 1 part perlite or horticultural sand. DO NOT use potting soil or compost because it will kill the plant. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Do not fertilize. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide plants when they are crowded in the pot. Or sow seeds in spring.

 Pygmy Date Palm Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Phoenix roebelenii 
  
 Pygmy Date Palm is a dwarf plant reaching several feet tall after several years. Give it some space, though. This 
 slow-growing palm will spread to about 4 ft wide. 
  
  
 Its long, arching fronds feature slender, delicate-looking leaflets. Unlike other date palms, this one has 
 soft leaflets giving it a feathery, elegant look. 
 There are sharp spines at the bases of the 
 leaflets, so it's a good idea to wear garden gloves when trimming off old fronds. 
 Brown leaf tips? 
 If the tips of the leaflets turn brown and crispy, the air is too dry. This Southeastern Asia native needs a humid environment. Mist the plant often or use a room 
 humidifier to  
 raise the humidity 
  in the air around it. 
 Wondering whether to repot? 
  Repot a young plant in spring every couple years, to give it the space it needs to grow. When it gets older, just top 
 dress by replacing the top couple inches of soil. Pygmy Date Palm has delicate roots and doesn't like to be disturbed. Use 
 a heavy container to prevent it from toppling because this spreading palm gets top-heavy. 
 Watch for pests. 
  
 Scale insects 
  are brown, oval bugs that 
 tend to hide out on the undersides of the fronds, along the midrib. As scale feed on plants, they excrete honeydew -- 
 a sticky substance that often attracts sooty mold. Isolate an affected plant and treat any infestation immediately.  
 Buying tip: Another common name for  
 this plant 
  Dwarf Date Palm. 
 This palm is usually sold by the species name. Look for  
 Phoenix roebelenii 
 to be sure you're getting this plant. 
  
  
  
 Pygmy Date Palm Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia 
 Height: 
 Up to 7 ft (1.8 m) indoors 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light. Strong morning light from an East-facing window will give your palm 
 the light it needs. Give the plant a quarter turn every week to expose all sides to sunlight. 
 Water: 
  
 This plant doesn't require a lot of attention, but be careful not to overwater it. Poor drainage and soggy soil 
 can cause root rot. 
 Keep soil moist spring through summer and barely moist in fall and winter. 
 Humidity: 
 This tropical native likes high humidity. When the relative humidity drops below 50%, stand the pot on a pebble 
 tray or use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-85°F/18-29°C year-round. It will tolerate a minimum of 55°F/13°C in winter. 
 Soil: 
  Use a potting mix that drains well. I recommend adding perlite or sand to a standard potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed once in spring and again in summer with a time-release fertilizer. Rose fertilizer works well 
 because it provides the micronutrients this palm needs. A shortage of magnesium will cause yellow spots on the leaflets. 
 Propagation: 
 Cut off the suckers that grow at the base of the plant. Be sure to include the roots with it, and 
 pot them in separate containers. Plants can be grown from seeds, but you'll wait years for the plant to grow into a tree.

 Rabbit Foot Fern 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Davallia fejeensis 
 Although most types of ferns require high humidity, Rabbit Foot Fern is much easier to please as indoor ferns. 
 House plants will thrive with indirect light and average room temperatures. 
 Elegant, lacy fronds create a lush mound of evergreen foliage. The main attraction of this plant, 
 however, are the furry rhizomes that hang over the side of the container. These light-brown, creeping rhizomes are covered 
 with hairs that look like a rabbit's foot. 
 It's a good idea to put the plant in a hanging basket because they 
 can grow up to 2 ft (60 cm) long. And because you want to show them off, don't you? 
 Those furry rhizomes are more than eye-catching -- they take up moisture. Mist them every day -- or as needed -- 
 with tepid water to prevent them from drying out. 
  
  
  
  
 This Pacific island native tends to lose some of its leaflets in winter. This is normal, and don't worry...this vigorous 
 plant will replace them.  
 Raising the humidity 
  can help. 
 Repot in spring only when it gets crowded in its pot. Rabbit's foot fern has a shallow root system, so 
 move it to a shallow pot only 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) wider. Keep the furry rhizomes on the soil surface because if you bury 
 them, they'll easily rot. This is a good time to divide the plant, if you want. 
  
 Winter care: 
  Cut back on watering during the winter months, 
 when growth slows. Put rabbit foot fern in a cooler spot for the winter, but don't 
 expose it to temperatures below 55°F/13°C. Keep it away from heat vents and 
 drafts. 
  
  
 You may find this fern in garden centers and nurseries in spring and summer. You can 
 also buy rabbit's foot fern online.

 Rabbit Foot Fern Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Fiji 
 Height: 
  18 in (46 cm) 
 Light: 
  Moderate to bright light. Keep it out of direct sun, which will scorch its leaflets.  
 Fluorescent grow lights 
  work well, too. 
 Water: 
  Spring through fall, keep the soil moist, but not soggy. In winter, allow top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate humidity. 
 Hot, dry air will cause frond tips to turn brown. 
 Trim off brown leaf tips and  
 raise humidity 
  around it. 
 Use a cool-mist room humidifier or place pot on a tray of wet pebbles 
 . This fern also loves to be misted. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C spring through fall. In winter, keep it on the cool side 
 with a minimum of 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
  Any good potting mix that drains well. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Division. In spring and summer, divide rhizomes, each with roots and stems attached. Pot in moist potting mix. 
 The rhizomes hold a lot of water, so be careful not to overwater or they'll rot.

 Rex Begonia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Begonia rex 
  hybrids 
 A long-time favorite of house plant lovers, Rex Begonia is grown for its colorful, 
 textured foliage. 
 Fancy-leafed begonias produce dramatic, large leaves streaked, veined, or splashed in shades of silver, pink, purple, cream, green, or burgundy. 
  
  
  
 Begonia rex 'Fireworks' is one of the most popular cultivars. It's easy to see why. Image by  
 Anna Zaro 
  
 Tiny, insignificant flower clusters may grow on tall stems. Flowers use the plant's energy, which is better used to grow those magnificent leaves. Pinch them off as soon as you see them to encourage large leaves 
 . 
 This begonia is rhizomatous, growing from a thick, fleshy rhizome that grows just below the surface of the soil. 
 Repot in spring when the rhizome outgrows the pot. Because rhizomes have shallow roots, a shallow pot will do. 
 Rex begonia can be difficult to grow because of its need for high humidity. Dry, brittle leaves are a symptom 
 of dry air. A terrarium,  
 Wardian case 
  or 
 glass cloche 
  may be just the solution for your 
 humidity-loving begonias. 
  
 Begonia rex 'Looking Glass' is a classic -- and one of my favorites. 
  
 Begonia Rex Varieties 
  
 There are 100s of hybrids to choose from. Some are upright, but most are low-growing. 
 Choose the one you like...they're all spectacular. 
 Some of the many popular named varieties include:  
 'Merry Christmas' 
  in red and green...  
 'Fireworks' 
 is stunning with silvery green, black and purple markings...  
 'Escargot' 
  (shown at bottom) is popular for its 
 snail-like spiral-shaped leaves. 
 Dwarf types are ideal for dish gardens and terrariums. 
  
 Rex Begonia Problems and Solutions 
  
 Dropped leaves? 
  Fancy-leafed begonias sometimes drop their leaves and become dormant in the winter. If this happens, cut off the withered 
 leaves, stop watering, and enclose the plant in a plastic bag. Keep it at 60°F/16°C until new growth appears, 
 in approximately 6-10 weeks. Then continue with normal care. 
 Dry, crispy leaves 
  may be a symptom of dry soil, dry air or direct sunlight. Keep rex begonia in bright, indirect light and boost the humidity around it. 
 Yellow leaves 
  are caused by overwatering. It's a good idea to use a small pot with drainage holes. Water thoroughly, then empty drainage tray. If you want to use a cachepot (a pot without drainage holes), slip a plain nursery pot into the cachepot. Put pebbles in the bottom of the cachepot to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Spots on leaves 
  are typically  
 fungal-related 
 . Spots with yellow halos are bacterial leaf spot. Tan spots are a symptom of botrytis fungus that attacks plants in cool, wet conditions. Cut off affected leaves and increase air circulation around your plant. Warm sunshine will help prevent fungus. 
 Something bugging your begonia? 
  Check your plant for  
 aphids 
  (they're attracted to soft, new growth) and  
 fungus gnats 
  (that are drawn to wet, peaty potting mixes). Treat any infestation right away. Don't use an insecticide spray on rex begonias because it will damage them. 
 Is rex begonia poisonous? 
  Yes -- it contains calcium oxalate that is extremely toxic to cats and dogs. It's not a good choice for a home with curious pets that may play with or chew on plants. 
  
 Rex Begonia Care Tips 
  
 Begonia rex 'Escargot' 
  
 Origin: 
   Southeast Asia and India 
 Height: 
  Up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, but no direct midday sun in summer, which can scorch the leaves. Thrives under  
 fluorescent light 
 , which will help these fancy-leafed begonias keep their color and variegation. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist at all times, but be careful not to overwater because the rhizomes are prone to rot in soggy soil. 
 Avoid getting water on leaves 
 because water may cause bacterial leaf spot. Yellow leaves are a symptom of soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
  High humidity is a must. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, stand the pot on a tray of wet pebbles, or use a  
 small 
 humidifier 
 . Do not mist because water can cause spots to form on leaves. Dry air can cause dry, brittle leaves. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C) all year-round. 
 Soil: 
  Use a peat-moss based mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite for fast draining, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended rate on the package. Stop fertilizing dormant plants. 
 Propagation: 
  Take leaf cuttings in spring or summer. Cut a healthy, medium-sized leaf with 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) 
 stem. Poke stem at a 45° angle in moist half-and-half mixture of peat moss and perlite. Enclose the whole 
 thing in a plastic bag to hold in humidity. Keep the cutting in a warm spot (75-80°F/24-27°C) in indirect light. 
 Leaf cuttings usually root in about 3-4 weeks, but it takes about another 4 weeks for plantlets to form. Pot up 
 each plantlet when it has 3 leaves, and cut away the parent leaf.

 How to Grow Rosary Vine 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Ceropegia linearis woodii 
 Whether you call it Rosary Vine or String of Hearts, you'll be captivated by 
 this charming house plant. 
  
  
  
 Pairs of heart-shaped leaves grow about every 3 in (8 cm) along the slender stems. 
 Decorative all on their own, the leaves are splotched with a lacy pattern of white on the top and 
 are purple underneath.

 Propagate your plant. 
 Small tubers sometimes grow along the stems, causing the stems to branch out. 
 You can remove the tubers anytime and set them on the surface of the soil to grow more plants in the same pot. 
 Prune it back 
  when Rosary Vine starts to look leggy. Propagating the stem cuttings by inserting them back 
 in the soil will give a fuller display that's lush with leaves. 
 Repot in spring 
  when it gets crowded, moving to a pot only 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) bigger. This vining plant grows 
 from 2-inch (5 cm) tubers. Place them on the surface of the soil. Use a sandy mix and a pot with a 
 drainage hole to avoid soggy soil, which can cause the tubers to rot. 
  
 Why You Should Grow Rosary Vine 
  
 This carefree classic beauty was once an extremely popular indoor plant, but not as common these days. Perhaps it 
 has fallen out of favor because it is 
 so easy to grow 
 ? Somehow easy-care plants get less respect. If you 
 come across this beautiful succulent vine, buy it. It's long-lived and easy to propagate for more plants. 
 You may find rosary vine for sale at online nurseries or at your local garden center. 
 It is usually labeled by its genus and subspecies names, 
 Ceropegia woodii 
 .

 Rosary Vine Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  Trails to 3 ft (90 cm) or more 
 Light: 
  Keep your plant in bright light (with some direct sun) 
 for best color and plenty of leaves. 
 Long spaces between leaves are a sign it's not getting enough sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil lightly moist in spring and summer. Water sparingly in fall and winter. A 
 semi-succulent, this plant is more tolerant of dry soil than wet. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate (around 40-50% relative humidity). If indoor air is dry, use one of these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplant. 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C). Don't expose this warm-natured plant to temps below 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
  Mix 1 part good-quality, all-purpose potting mix and 1 part sand or perlite for fast drainage. Cactus potting mix also works well. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in spring and summer with water-soluble fertilizer. Don't feed in fall and winter when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem tip cuttings and insert cut ends in moist soil. Or cut off stem 
 tubers and place them on the surface of the soil.

 Rubber Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Ficus elastica 
 Rubber Plant is a bold evergreen that gets its name from the sticky sap 
 that dries into a low-quality rubber. 
 It is popular as a house plant, however, because of its large, leathery, glossy leaves that can grow to 
 8 in (20 cm) long or more -- and because it is so easy to grow. 
  
  
  
  
 Rubber Plant Varieties 
  
 There are many named varieties to choose from:  
 'Robusta' 
  is the most common with large, solid green foliage. 
 'Decora' 
 has big, glossy, dark-green leaves that grow up to 12 in (30 cm) long... 
 'Melany' 
 is more compact 
 and branching. 
 Several varieties have reddish leaves, such as 
 'Burgundy' 
 , and some newer 
 cultivars have variegated leaves. 
 'Doescheri' 
 is splashed with green, gray-green and creamy yellow or white. 
 'Tricolor' 
 has gray-green leaves that are variegated with cream and pink.  
 'Tineke' 
  is variegated with light-and-dark green and edged with creamy white.

 Caring for Rubber Plant Year-Round 
  
 Just like many other plants in the Moraceae family, this one doesn't like to be moved around. Sudden changes in temperature 
 and light may cause rubber plant to drop its leaves, although it's not as fussy as its cousin, the  
 weeping fig 
 . 
 Repot in spring  
 only 
  when its roots fill the pot -- rubber plant likes to be slightly pot-bound. 
 Use a container with drainage holes to prevent overwatering. Never repot a plant that's shedding its leaves, which will 
 make the problem worse. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  The central stem will typically grow straight, without branching. Regular pruning of the growing tip will encourage side branches to form as it grows. You can control its height by simply cutting off the top when it becomes too tall and lanky. Use sharp pruning shears to avoid tearing the stems. 
  
  
 Water regularly to keep it healthy. Leaves that turn yellow and fall off are a sign that it's overwatered. However, 
 it's perfectly natural for older, lower leaves turn yellow, then brown and eventually fall off. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
 Check for signs of 
 scale insects 
 and 
 mealybugs 
 that may infest rubber plant. Care should be taken to treat any 
 problems as soon as you notice them. 
 Watch for sooty mold 
 . It's not a disease; this black dusty mold grows 
 on leaves covered by the honeydew 
 excreted by sap-sucking insects, such as scale. 
 You can remove it by simply wiping off the affected leaves with mild soapy water. 
 Keep leaves dust-free and shiny by  
 gently 
  wiping them off with a damp cloth. Young leaves are easily damaged; bending or scraping foliage will scar them for life. 
  
  
 Rubber Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  India and Malaysia 
 Height: 
  Up to 10 ft (3 m) in a container 
 Light: 
  Give  
 Ficus elastica 
  bright indirect sunlight year-round. Some morning sun is fine, but keep out of hot, direct midday sun. Rubber plant will drop its leaves if it doesn't get enough light. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist. 
 Use a pot with a drainage hole, water thoroughly, then empty drainage tray. 
 Be careful not to overwater, which will cause root rot. Drooping yellow leaves are a symptom of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
  Relative humidity around 40% is ideal. Indoor humidity can plummet in winter, so it's a good idea to  
 increase the humidity 
  for your tropical houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. Rubber plant will tolerate a minimum of 50°F/10°C in winter. Protect  
 Ficus elastica 
  from blasts of hot or cold air from heat/AC vents, doors and windows. It doesn't like sudden temperature swings, which may cause its leaves to fall off. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once a month spring through summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take stem cuttings in spring. To keep its sticky, white sap from forming a cap on the base of the cutting, 
 place the tip in water for 30 minutes. Remove from the water and dip only the cut surface in  
 rooting hormone 
 . Then insert it 
 into moist potting mix to root.

 Growing Sago Palm Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Cycas revoluta 
  
 Sago Palm belongs to one of the oldest-known plant families and is one of the most majestic. Despite its common 
 name, it's not really a palm but a Cycad, one of the most primitive of plant families that covered the earth 
 during the age of dinosaurs 200 million years ago. 
  
  
  
  
 This tropical plant is extremely slow-growing, but over many years develops a substantial trunk. 
 Topping the trunk is a rosette of shiny, stiff, narrow fronds arching slightly at their tips. Although the rigid leaves 
 appear tough, they are easily damaged and should be handled carefully. 
  
 Sago Palm care is easy if you keep a few things in mind. It doesn't like its feet wet, so keep the soil on 
 the dry side. Give it light every day and fertilize lightly during the growing season. 
 This plant doesn't really like to be disturbed, so repot only when necessary. Pruning can be done anytime to remove dead fronds. 
  
  
 Water carefully. 
  Sago Palm problems are usually related to watering. Yellowing leaves are often caused by overwatering. Follow the watering 
 instructions below to avoid crown rot. It's almost impossible to treat and plants may not recover. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  
 Scale insects 
 are the 
 most common pest. Look over your plant often for scale and treat any infestation immediately with insecticide. 
 Is Sago Palm poisonous? 
  Yes. 
  All parts of  
 Cycas revoluta 
  are poisonous, especially the seeds which can be lethal. Keep it out of the reach of children, cats and dogs 
 that may play with or ingest this plant. 
 Cycas revoluta 
  is a long-lived plant. Fifty-plus year-old plants are not uncommon. It is becoming more popular and easier to find in garden centers and online nurseries. 
  
 Sago Palm Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Tropical Asia 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors. Can be kept dwarfed by growing it in a small pot. Sago Palm is also popularly grown as a bonsai tree. 
 Light: 
  Bright light with some direct sun. Turn the pot a quarter turn at least once a week during the growing season. Otherwise, 
 the plant will lean toward the light source. 
 Water: 
 Take care to water the soil, not the crown of the plant which can lead to crown rot and may kill the plant. 
 Water thoroughly and allow the soil to dry out a bit between waterings, but don't allow it to dry out completely. Water less in winter when growth is slower. Provide good 
 drainage. 
 Humidity: 
  
 This tropical native prefers relative humidity above 50%. 
 You can set it on a tray of wet pebbles to raise the humidity around it. 
 If your home is really dry, use a  
 room humidifier 
  for best results. 
 Temperature: 
 Normal room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C 
 Soil:  
 Cactus potting mix 
 works well for fast drainage. Or combine 2 parts peat-moss based potting mix and 1 part horticultural sand or 
 perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a liquid fertilizer (such as 18-6-18) diluted by half. Only fertilize 
 when watering to avoid fertilizer burn. A slow-release fertilizer also works well, but I only use half the amount recommended 
 on the package. The leaves will shrivel and dry up when it has been over-fed. 
 Propagation: 
  Seeds take months to germinate and years to grow into a tree. Everything about this plant is s-l-o-w. Mature 
 plants grow offsets -- called  
 pups 
  -- that can be separated and planted into their own containers.

 Satin Pothos 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Scindapsus pictus 
 'Argyraeus' 
  
 Satin Pothos is just as easy to grow as its relative, golden pothos ( 
 Epipremnum aureum 
 ). Keep 
 it warm and take care not to overwater this house plant. Cold drafts and soggy soil are two things 
 it won't tolerate. 
 You'll see the best leaf color and variegation by keeping it in bright, indirect light. You'll also 
 keep the plant healthy by boosting the humidity around it. In fact, its variegated foliage makes Satin Pothos a beautiful addition 
 to a terrarium. 
  
  
  
 Long vines are densely covered with beautifully patterned leaves. 
  
 This striking tropical plant is fairly new to house plant nurseries, and is garnering a lot of attention. 
 Big, heart-shaped leaves are dark-green and splashed with silvery gray, giving them a satin sheen. 
 Its compact growth habit makes  
 Scindapsus pictus 
  'Argyraeus' a beautiful hanging basket plant. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Your plant will benefit from occasional pruning, which helps it to branch out and become fuller. Spring is the best time to cut it back. Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems. 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
  when the plant outgrows its pot. Use a pot only 1-2 inches bigger, because a much larger container will hold too much water. It's a good idea to use a pot with drainage holes. If you want to use a  
 cachepot 
  (decorative container without drainage holes), slip a plain nursery pot in the cachepot. I put pebbles in the bottom of my cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Satin pothos problems usually show in its leaves.  
 Brown leaf tips 
  are caused by dry air.  
 Yellow leaves 
  are a symptom of too much water.  
 Brown spots surrounded by yellow halos 
  indicate bacterial leaf spot. Cut off affected leaves. Take care not to get the leaves wet when watering. 
  
 Satin Pothos Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia 
 Height: 
  Trails to 3 ft (90 cm) or more. You can cut the stems back to any length, if you want a smaller houseplant. 
 Light: 
  
 Give  
 Scindapsus pictus 
 bright, indirect light year-round. 
 Harsh direct sunlight will scorch its leaves, while too-little light will cause the leaves 
 to lose their variegation. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly and allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Keep soil barely moist in winter. 
 Yellow leaves are a symptom of overwatering. Always use room-temperature water when watering houseplants an provide good drainage. 
 Humidity: 
  Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity around your plant. Use a  
 room humidifier 
  or a humidity tray 
 in winter, if the air is dry. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm 65-85°F/18-29°C. Don't expose Satin Pothos to temperatures below 
 60°F/16°C, even for a short time because cold air will damage the foliage of this tropical plant. 
 Soil: 
  Use all-purpose houseplant potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a 20-10-10 water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4 inch (10 cm) tip cuttings in spring or early summer and insert them into moist peat moss 
 based potting mix. Cuttings root easily in about a month.

 Schefflera House Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Schefflera spp. 
  
  
  
  
 It also goes by the name Umbrella Tree. This tropical plant has been a common house plant a long time, and it's easy to see why. It makes a beautiful accent for any brightly lit room. 
 Its upright branching stems bear horizontal spoke-like leaves that consist of about 8 
 large, dark-green leaflets. 
 A dwarf variety ( 
 Schefflera arboricola 
 ) exists -- it is a much smaller and bushier plant. 'Variegata' (shown below) 
 is a variegated form with green and cream leaves. 
  
  
 Caring for Schefflera Year-Round 
  
 Schefflera plant care is easy. Put it in a bright spot, out of direct sun and place the container on a saucer of wet pebbles 
 to increase the humidity around it. 
 Pruning schefflera 
 may be necessary on large plants. As the plant ages, it loses its lower leaves, becoming leggy. 
 Prune it back harshly to stimulate new growth and to keep it full. Pinching off the growing tips will promote branching. 
 Dropped leaves? 
  Schefflera doesn't like to be moved around and may drop its leaves if exposed to cold drafts or 
 blasts of hot air from heating vents. 
 Keep leaves clean 
  by gently wiping them with a soft, damp cloth. Built-up dust interferes with photosynthesis so it's a good idea to wipe leaves every couple weeks to keep your plant healthy. My Schefflera had leafshine product sprayed on its leaves when I bought it, but it's not necessary. Those pinwheel leaves are naturally glossy. 
 Repot in spring 
 when roots grow through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. Use a heavy pot to 
 prevent toppling -- this plant can get top-heavy. 
 Pests are few 
 , however  
 spider mites 
  
 may invade if the air is dry. Keep an eye out for webbing between stems and the undersides of leaves.  
 Raising the humidity 
  
 around the plant in winter will help to prevent an invasion. 
  
  
 Schefflera Plant Buying Tips 
  
 Buying a new Schefflera? 
 Choose a plant based on the size and type you want. They're all easy to grow. 
 With good care, this beautiful, tropical house plant will live for many years. 
  
  
 Schefflera Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Australia and Pacific Islands 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 ft (1.8 m). Tall Schefflera plants will need support. Mature plants have aerial roots that can be trained to cling to a moss stick. 
 Light: 
  Bright light, no direct sun. Turn plant occasionally in front of the window to encourage even growth. Variegated types of Schefflera that fade aren't getting enough light. Leggy stems with long spaces between leaves are another symptom of too little light. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly to get all the roots wet. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Yellow leaves are a sign of overwatering. Drooping 
 leaves usually indicate that the soil is too dry. 
 Humidity: 
 Average or higher indoor (about 40-50% relative humidity). If your home gets too dry in the winter, use a cool-mist room humidifier or mist with water. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C). This tropical native doesn't like either hot or cold drafts -- and may protest by shedding its leaves. Keep Schefflera away from cold windows and doors in the winter, as well as blasts from AC or heat vents. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly with a water-soluble houseplant fertilizer that includes micronutrients. New leaves that seem wilted and pale may be suffering from lack of fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem tip cuttings in spring and summer.

 Variegated Screw Pine 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pandanus veitchii 
 Variegated Screw Pine makes a handsome houseplant. It's long-lived, too. 
 Give this tropical plant what it wants and you'll enjoy it for many years. 
  
  
  
 Pandanus veitchii makes a handsome houseplant for any brightly lit room. 
  
 Screw Pine is fast-growing and will need plenty of room. Even young plants quickly grow a trunk, with leaves spiraling upward. 
 Those arching, creamy yellow-and-green striped leaves will eventually grow up to 3 ft (90 cm) long. It's a good idea to set your plant where it won't be brushed against -- the spiny edges are sharp. 
 As plants mature, they'll develop aerial roots. In their native seaside habitat, those stilt roots help to anchor plants from strong winds. Of course, aerial roots are not needed on plants grown indoors -- you can simply tuck them into the pot. 
  
 Screw Pine Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Brown leaf tips 
  are typically caused by dry air. Give this tropical plant high humidity like its native Polynesia and you'll make it feel right at home. 
 Variegated leaves that turn all green 
  is from lack of sunlight. Move Screw Pine to a brighter location. See "light" tips below. 
 Repot in spring 
  every year to give it room to grow. Move  
 Pandanus veitchii 
  to a pot 1-2" (2.5-5 cm) larger. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Watch for  
 spider mites 
  that thrive in dry air during the winter months. These sap-sucking pests cause yellow spots on leaves and may cause leaf tips to curl. You'll probably first notice the fine webbing between leaves. Another possible pest are brown  
 scale insects 
  along the leaves. Treat any infestation immediately to prevent them from moving on to your other indoor plants. 
 Clean leaves regularly. 
 Dust can interfere with photosynthesis, which helps plants to transform light into energy they need to grow. Keep leaves dust-free by wiping them with a damp cloth. Regular cleaning also helps to prevent spider mites. 
  
 Variegated Screw Pine Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands 
 Height: 
  About 5 ft (1.5 m) indoors 
 Light: 
  Bright light with some full sun. Leaves that turn all green are not getting enough light. You can move your plant outdoors for the summer, if you want, but keep it shaded from strong midday sun. Screw Pine thrives under fluorescent light, too, making it an ideal office plant. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly to wet all roots, allowing water to drain through drainage holes. Allow potting medium to dry out slightly before watering again. Water less often in winter, when growth is slower. Remember to always use tepid water when watering your houseplants. 
 Humidity: 
 Give this tropical native at least 50% relative humidity all year. Homes can become extremely dry in winter; it's a good idea to use a humidity monitor rather than guess. The most efficient way to boost humidity for tropical plants is with a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature 
 : 
  Average to warm (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. Keep Screw Pine away from cold drafts, including A/C vents. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality potting medium with a couple handfuls of horticultural sand mixed in for faster drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. Don't feed in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
  Mature plants will grow offshoots -- called  
 pups 
  -- that can be cut away and potted separately.

 How to Grow Sensitive Plant  
 (Mimosa pudica) Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Mimosa pudica 
  
 It won't giggle like Elmo, but Sensitive Plant has a big reaction to being tickled. Its leaves quickly fold up 
 -- and the entire stem collapses -- when touched, making it a fascinating plant to watch. 
  
  
  
 Did you know...Pudica is Latin for shy, given to this plant because of its shrinking reaction if disturbed. 
  
 Sensitive plant closes it leaves at night and opens them again in the morning. The leaves also fold up 
 if the plant is shaken or exposed to heat. In fact, high temperatures (75-85°F/24-29°C) may trigger 
 the leaves to close. 
 It only takes a few minutes, though, for the leaves to slowly unfold and the stems to straighten up. 
 The feathery, fern-like leaves are made up of 25 pairs of tiny leaflets. 
  
 The foliage is attractive on its own, but you'll be captivated by the profusion of pink pompon flowers that 
 bloom from summer into fall. 
  
 Mimosa pudica grows quickly and blooms prolifically with enough sunlight. Photo credit: PetJ 
  
 Mimosa pudica 
 is a perennial shrub, but is often treated like an annual and tossed out, 
 because it tends to deteriorate after flowering. Younger plants are more beautiful, anyway, and 
 sensitive plant seed is quick and easy to grow. 
 Put your potted plant outside for the summer, if you want, to give it the light it needs. Just don't plant 
 it in the garden. It's considered invasive in warm-climate areas and will spread like a weed. 
 Sensitive plant is fast growing. Repot when you see roots coming through the pot's drainage holes. 
  
  
 TickleMe Plant Greenhouse Kit 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 You'll sometimes find this plant for sale as Touch Me Plant or Tickle Me Plant™. 
 The kit shown here includes  
 Mimosa pudica 
 seeds, a plastic greenhouse to hold in humidity, 6 mini flower pots 
 and 6 soil pellets -- everything you need to easily grow your own plants. 
 Give your plants plenty of light, keep them moist and warm and you should see sprouts in about a week. 
  
  
 Mimosa Pudica Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Central and South Americas 
 Height: 
 Up to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light with some direct sun. They'll thrive under  
 grow lights 
 , too. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist, not soggy. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (above 40% relative humidity). Set plant on a  
 humidity tray 
 or use a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 70-75°F/21-24°C. High heat may cause its leaves to collapse. It's a good idea to keep your plant away from entryways and heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix with added perlite for faster drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a high-potassium liquid or other water-soluble fertilizer -- diluted by half -- while plant is 
 growing. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds. Sow sensitive plant seed in early spring. The seed coatings are tough and 
 need scarification to help germinate. Use a sharp knife to (gently) nick the seed coating to expose the 
 white inside of the seed. Barely cover the seeds with potting mix. Keep the medium moist and warm. Seeds 
 should germinate in about a week.

 Snow Bush 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Breynia nivosa 
  
 Traditionally a tropical garden plant, Snow Bush is slowly becoming recognized as a house plant -- and for good reason. This Pacific Island native is an exquisite accent plant any brightly lit room. 
 Slender branches of this tropical shrub are densely covered with rounded green leaves, spectacularly splashed 
 with white. The variety 'Rosea Picta' adds pink to the white and green foliage, giving the false impression of a 
 flowering shrub.

 Flowers do sometimes appear on mature plants, although they're not at all showy. These odd-looking, petalless flowers 
 are small and green, hiding under the foliage. 
 Keep it moist. 
 Make this tropical beauty feel at home by boosting the humidity around it. Set the pot on a pebble tray 
 or use a room humidifier to keep the relative humidity above 50%. Also  
 keep the soil moist at all times 
 . 
 Cut it back. 
 Snow Bush grows quickly and will get quite large if not pruned. Cut the stems with sharp 
 pruners to avoid tearing them. Make the cut just above a leaf node at a 45° angle. Prune to your heart's content -- 
 you won't hurt this vigorous grower. 
 Repot in spring. 
 This fast-growing shrub will need a new home every couple years. Move it up to a pot 
 one size larger when it outgrows its current one. 
 It is surprising that we don't see Snowbush more often in nurseries. 
 If you come across this beautiful tropical plant, buy it. You'll enjoy it first as a 
 table accent -- and as it grows, an eye-catching floor plant. 
  
 Snow Bush Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Tropical Asia, Pacific Islands and Tropical Australia 
 Height: 
 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light. Give your plant a quarter-turn every week or so to expose all sides to sunlight for even growth. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly and often to maintain moist soil. Do not allow the soil to dry out at any time. Remember to always use tepid water when watering your houseplants. 
 Humidity: 
  
 Give your plant the humid air it craves, like its 
 native tropical home. Try to maintain a least 50% relative humidity around the plant. 
 Stand the pot on a pebble tray or use a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. This tender tropical will tolerate 
 a minimum of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality houseplant potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 to 3 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem tip cuttings in summer and root them in moist sterile potting mix. Cover the whole thing 
 with plastic to hold in the humidity until it takes root. For best results, use a seedling heat mat to maintain an even 70°F/21°C.

 How to Grow Spider Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Chlorophytum comosum 
 Spider Plant is an impressive house plant for beginners. It's easy to care for, tolerates average room conditions, and is easy to propagate. 
 The slender, arching leaves are dark green with a creamy white stripe. Leaves grow from a central crown and can reach up to 1 ft 
 (30 cm) long. Give this plant plenty of light for the best leaf color. Plants grown in low light may lose their variegation. 
  
  
  
 Spider plants look best in 
 hanging baskets 
 or on tall stands or 
 pedestals 
 to show off their trailing foliage. 
 Their variegated leaves and graceful, fountain-like growing habit add a beautiful contrast and texture when grouped with other house plants. 
  
  
 When less than a year old, the plant produces small, white flowers on the tips of wiry, upright stems, called runners. 
 The runners are soon weighted down with plantlets giving it a spidery appearance. 
 These plantlets -- often called "babies" -- are easy to propagate, giving you an ongoing supply of plants. For sure success, 
 choose young, small plantlets for propagating because the larger plantlets are older and will root slowly. (See "Propagation" below 
 for all the how-tos.) 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
 when the plant has outgrown its pot. If you see roots growing out of the drainage holes, it's time to pot up. For the best growth and flowering, use a pot that's only 1 to 2 inches larger. 
 No blooms? 
  These plants like to be slightly root-bound and will flower and produce plantlets best when grown 
 in a smallish container. Also, take it easy on the fertilizer -- too much will produce a lot of leaves, but no flowers and plantlets. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  often seen on this plant are caused by fluoride, often present in tap water. 
 Use distilled water, rainwater, or allow tap water to sit overnight so that the chemicals 
 in the water will dissipate. 
 Snip off brown leaf tips with scissors to keep the plant looking neat. 
  
 Buy a Spider Plant 
  
 This is one of the best plants for improving air quality indoors. It has one of the top removal rates of 
 formaldehyde from tainted indoor air. 
 You'll find a couple types available. 
 'Vittatum' 
  is the most common variety, featuring a central white stripe on its foliage. 
 'Variegatum' 
  has broader green leaves with white margins. 
  
  
  
 Spider Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Pacific and South Africa 
 Height: 
  Plants grow up to 1 ft (30 cm) tall, with stems trailing to 3 ft (90 cm) in length. 
 Light: 
  Give your plant bright, indirect light to maintain the variegation on the leaves. Keep plant out of direct sunlight because it can scorch leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist. If your tap water contains fluoride, use distilled or rainwater to prevent brown leaf tips on your plant. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate indoor humidity. If the leaves turn brown and crispy,  
 raise the humidity 
  around it. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temps 65-75°F/18-24°C suit this tropical plant perfectly. It doesn't like the cold; don't expose it to 
 anything below 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
  Peat-moss based potting mix, such as African violet mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through summer with a liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Plantlets. Set a small pot filled with damp potting mix next to the plant. Sink a new plantlet into the 
 soil of the small pot, so that the root buds are barely covered. You may need to use a bent paperclip to hold the plantlet in place. 
 It should root in 2-3 weeks. After that time, sever it from the parent plant.

 Split-Leaf Philodendron 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Philodendron bipinnatifidum 
  
 Split-leaf philodendron is another 
 dependable house plant from the Araceae family. It also happens  
 to be one of the most captivating.

 Few houseplants make a huge impact like this one. This jungle giant is surprisingly easy to please indoors. Although it prefers high humidity, split-leaf philodendron is fairly tolerant of most homes. Use a room humidifier, if you need to boost the moisture in the air. 
 This stunning philodendron plant is a tree-like shrub. Young plants have sturdy, upright stems, 
 which tend to lie horizontally as the plant ages. They eventually sprawl to become twice as wide as 
 they are tall, so give your house plant plenty of room to spread out. You may want to stake up your plant to provide support. 
 The foliage is stunning. When young, the glossy, heart-shaped leaves are deeply indented, and 
 become more deeply cut as they grow. Some varieties of split-leaf philodendron have wavy margins. 
 Big leaves are dust-catchers. To clean them, gently wipe the leaves with a damp cloth. 
  
 Year-Round Care 
  
 Wondering whether to repot? 
 Pot up in spring or early summer when the roots fill the pot, usually every couple years. Use a container with drainage holes to prevent root rot. Once the plant gets big (top-heavy), it's a good idea to use a heavy container to prevent it from toppling. 
 What do you do with aerial roots? 
 Long aerial roots may appear near the base of the plant. 
 You can cut off a few with pruners without hurting this plant. Better yet, 
 tuck them back into the pot or coil them on top of the soil. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  New plant growth may attract 
 aphids 
 , which can cause yellow specks and crinkled leaves. Treat any infestation immediately. 
  
 Varieties and Buying Tips 
  
 This plant is also known as  
 P. selloum 
  and may be sold under that name. 
 A few named varieties make good house plants. 
 'Xanadu' philodendron is a newer cultivar with smaller leaves than 
 the species and only grows to 3 ft (90 cm) wide. 
 'Hope' is a vigorous, full-sized hybrid. 'German Selloum' has 
 finely cut leaves with wavy lobes. 
 Looking for this look-alike? 
 There is a similar-looking plant that goes by the same common name.  
 Swiss Cheese Plant 
  
 isn't a philodendron at all -- it is  
 Monstera deliciosa 
 . 
  
 Split-Leaf Philodendron Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
 To 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors, depending on variety 
 Light: 
  Moderate to bright light. No direct sun, which can cause brown scorch marks on the leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil moist spring through fall. Allow surface to dry out between waterings in winter. Yellow leaves 
 are caused by overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
  This rainforest native prefers relative humidity above 40%. Mist foliage occasionally. If your home is really dry, use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  to boost moisture in the air around it. Brown leaf tips may be caused by dry air. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round. Split-leaf philodendron will tolerate a low of 60°F/16°C in winter. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 npk) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. Lack of nutrients may cause little or no growth and small leaves. 
 Propagation: 
 Division. Cut through the thick roots with a serrated knife and pot up the plants separately.

 Staghorn Fern Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Platycerium bifurcatum 
  
 Antler-like fronds give staghorn fern its common name. It's also known as elkhorn fern. 
 Staghorns grow as 
 epiphytes 
 in tropical Australia, growing on tree trunks.

 This stag horn fern actually has 2 types of fronds. Those at the base of the plant are flat, round and light green, 
 turning brown as they age. Epiphytes in their native habitats, staghorn ferns cling to tree trunks taking in 
 nutrients from fallen leaves and other debris that gets trapped behind these slightly curved sterile fronds. 
 The second type of fronds are fertile, growing from the basal fronds and can reach up to 3 ft (90 cm) long. These deeply lobed 
 fronds resemble staghorn deer antlers. They are green, covered with white, felty scales. 
 You can keep your young plant in a pot, but eventually the basal fronds will cover the growing medium making 
 it difficult to water from the top.  
 Don't saturate these fronds with water because they'll rot easily. 
 Water 
 pots from below by setting pot in a tray of water for 15 minutes. 
 Transplanting. 
 When your fern grows bigger, you may want to hang it in a sphagnum moss-lined wire basket 
 or mount it on tree bark or a slab of wood, which is closer to how these ferns grow in their native habitat. 
 Mounting staghorn fern. 
 Place a few handfuls of damp sphagnum moss or orchid mix on a piece of bark or 
 (untreated) wood board. Place the fern over the mound of medium, so that the flat, round basal fronds are touching the board. 
 Use twine, wire or fishing line to firmly hold the fern to the board. 
  
  
 Where to Buy Staghorn Ferns 
  
 Finding staghorn ferns for sale may be challenging. Because of their unusual growing habits and need 
 for high humidity, they are not common. Unless you live in a tropical region, your best bet is to 
 buy these ferns online. 
  
  
  
 Staghorn Fern Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
 Tropical Australia 
 Height: 
 Trails up to 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
 Stag horns fern grows best in bright, indirect light. Strong summer sun will damage its fronds. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, allowing medium to dry out between waterings. Water potted plants 
 from below for 15 minutes. For mounted ferns, plunge the root portion into room-temperature water for 15 minutes, 
 then drip-dry. It is better to err on the dry side -- mature plants are more tolerant of drought than soggy 
 medium, which can cause root rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Prefers moist air. 
 Dry indoor air will cause brown tips. 
 Mist the fronds regularly with room- 
 temperature water to keep the humidity high. 
 However, don't allow the base of the fern to stay wet, which may cause it to rot. If humidity drops dramatically in winter, use a  
 cool-mist  room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C are ideal. Staghorn fern will tolerate a minimum of 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
 Sphagnum moss or medium specially made for epiphytes such as bromeliad or orchid mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) foliar fertilizer or add fertilizer to water 
 and plunge the rootball portion into the water for several minutes. 
 Propagation: 
 Staghorns produce a large number of offsets -- called  
 pups 
  -- that can 
 be carefully removed and mounted separately. These ferns can also be propagated from spores that grow on the 
 tips of the lobed fronds, however the spores are slow and difficult to propagate and is not practical.

 Strawberry Begonia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Saxifraga stolonifera 
  
 Strawberry Begonia grows in a mound of rounded, scalloped leaves with decorative silvery veins. The 
 leaves are hairy with burgundy-red undersides. 
 Its most charming feature, though, are the long 
 runners with plantlets dangling from the plant. Display it in a hanging basket to show 
 them off.

 In its native habitats of China and Japan,  
 S. stolonifera 
 grows as a groundcover, spreading 
 quickly by its runners that readily take root. This plant likes cool temperatures, but is frost-tender. 
 Keep it cool and moist, and it makes an easy-care house plant. 
 Sprays of tiny, white star-shaped flowers on tall stems may appear in summer. You can encourage more flowers by allowing 
 a cool, dry rest for a few weeks in winter. 
  
 Growing Strawberry Begonia Year-Round

 Repot in spring 
  every couple years or when the roots fill the pot. Put it in a hanging pot 
 to show off its trailing plantlets. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Brown, crispy leaves? 
  Dry-looking foliage can be caused by a few things: 
  
 Direct sun can cause leaves to look faded or brown. Keep  
 Saxifraga stolonifera 
 out of strong summer sun. 
 Crispy, shriveled leaves are often a sign that the air is too dry. Use a pebble tray or a room humidifier to raise the humidity around the plant. Don't mist this plant because the tiny hairs trap water and may cause the leaves to rot. 
 Dry soil could also cause dry leaves. Aim to keep the soil lightly moist. 
  
 Winter Care 
 . Give this evergreen plant a dry, cool rest in winter. Keep it in a cool (50-55°F/10-13°C) place, 
 and water sparingly, but don't allow the soil to dry out. It'll suffer in the dry air caused by central heating. 
 Use a humidity tray or room humidifier, if necessary to raise the moisture in the air around it. Watch for an invasion of 
 spider mites 
 that are attracted to dry conditions. 
 Buying Tip: 
 A few varieties are available. 'Tricolor' has small, green leaves with creamy yellow margins and red 
 undersides. Rare variegated varieties exist with dark-green leaves edged in creamy white. 
 Did you know... 
 This plant is neither a strawberry nor a begonia. Its common name comes from those colorful, decorative leaves like a begonia 
 , and because it spreads by runners like a strawberry plant. 
 Strawberry Begonia is in the Saxifragaceae family, along with  
 Piggyback Plant 
 . 
 What these two have in common besides attractive foliage is a trailing habit 
 and their ability to produce plantlets that are easily propagated. 
  
 Strawberry Begonia Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  East Asia 
 Height: 
 Up to 8 in (20 cm); runners trail to 12 in (30 cm) or more. 
 Light: 
 Bright light year-round. Some direct morning sun is fine, but shade from strong sun, which 
 can cause leaves to fade. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly and allow the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil to dry between waterings. 
 Water less in winter, when growth is slower. Overwatering can lead to root rot or crown rot and may cause 
 fungus. 
 Humidity: 
 40-50% relative humidity. Use a pebble tray or a cool-mist humidifier if air is dry. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average room temperatures 50-75°F/10-24°C 
 Soil: 
 Any good-quality, all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Propagating is easy to do from runners. Place small pots around the parent plant. 
 Leave the runners attached and, using a bent paper clip, hold plantlets down into moist potting mix. The plantlets 
 will quickly form roots. After 3 weeks, you can cut the runners to detach them from the parent plant.

 Stromanthe Sanguinea 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Stromanthe sanguinea 
 Gorgeous foliage in dramatic colors make this Brazilian native a must-have for your indoor houseplant collection. 
  
  
  
 Give this tropical foliage plant plenty of light to keep its variegation. 
  
 Each emerald green leaf looks like a masterpiece, brushed with creamy white, light green and sometimes pink. Its leaves are sometimes held upright, revealing red undersides. 
 Those leaves are typically 10-12 inches long and are held on short, upright petioles.  
 If your plant changes its "look" throughout the day, there's a reason.  
 Stromanthe 
  is a member of the Marantaceae family of prayer plants. Its leaves turn to follow the sunlight throughout the day, then close at night, just like its family members. 
  
 Caring for Stromanthe Year-Round: Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Wondering when to repot Stromanthe? 
  Repot when the plant appears crowded, using a pot that's just 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger. Keep the crown of the plant at the same level it was in the old pot to prevent stem rot. Spring is a good time, when it is starting its most vigorous time of growth. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent over-watering. This is a good time to divide plants, if you want. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  may be caused by dry air. Give this South American rain forest native the moist air it craves year-round. (See "Humidity" below). It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge, rather than guess. Homes can become extremely dry in winter. 
 Pruning 
  isn't necessary, but older leaves can be cut off when they wither and turn brown. Use sharp pruners or scissors and cut them off close to the soil level. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Stromanthe seems to shrug off pests, though there are a couple to watch for. Dry, warm conditions in winter may draw  
 spider mites 
  to indoor plants. You'll first notice their fine webbing between leaves and stems. Treat any infestation immediately to prevent these destructive pests from moving on to your other houseplants. Wet, peaty potting mixes sometimes attract  
 fungus gnats 
 . Allowing the potting medium to dry out a bit between waterings will help prevent them.

 Stromanthe Sanguinea Varieties and Buying Tips 
  
 This tropical beauty is seldom seen in nurseries and garden centers, but it's well worth seeking. 
 Stromanthe sanguinea 
 'Tricolor' is a popular cultivar for its stunning cream, white and green leaves with red undersides. 'Triostar' is splashed with cream, pink and green with red underneath.

 Stromanthe Sanguinea Care 
  
 Origin: 
 Brazil 
 Height: 
 Up to 3 ft (90 cm) when confined to a container and grown indoors 
 Light: 
 Bright light is essential for good leaf color. 
 Put your plant where it'll get plenty of light, but 
 protect  
 Stromanthe sanguinea 
  from hot midday sun, which may cause brown scorch marks on leaves. 
 Water: 
 Allow top 1-inch (2.5 cm) to dry out before watering. Take care not to over-water -- soggy soil will 
 cause 
 Stromanthe sanguinea 
 stems to collapse, and may lead to root rot. It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole; water thoroughly, then empty drainage tray. Water less in winter, but don't allow the plant to dry out. 
 Humidity: 
 This tropical rain forest native wants at least 50% relative humidity. 
 Brown leaf tips indicate the humidity is too low. 
 Indoor air can become especially dry in winter; it a good idea to use a 
 cool-mist humidifier 
 near the plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round. Stromanthe doesn't like big fluctuations, but will tolerate temps as low as 60°F/16°C in winter. Keep plant away from cold drafts from entryways or blasts from A/C or heat vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix or other soilless potting medium. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed once a month spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble houseplant fertilizer. Stop feeding in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide clumps in spring and pot them separately.

 Round Leaved Sundew Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Drosera rotundifolia 
     
 If you like unusual plants, you'll want to add Sundew Plant to your collection. Its other-worldly foliage 
 and strange eating habits make it a fascinating carnivorous plant for the collector. 
 Sundew features long leaves that grow in a rosette. Round, disk-like leaves are covered with red glandular hairs 
 -- or tentacles -- that secrete a sticky juice, luring flies and other insects.

 Fooled into mistaking that glistening liquid for nectar, bugs are attracted to them. As soon as 
 the bugs land, they're stuck. Then the action starts: As the insect struggles, the leaf seems to gobble it, 
 holding the bug with its tentacles and smothering it. Sundews produce a digestive enzyme that breaks down 
 protein from the insect so that it can be absorbed by the plant. 
 You can expect small, white flowers to appear in summer, rising above the rosette on tall stems. Each flower is 
 short-lived, but you'll get dozens of blooms from healthy plants during the growing season. Wait for flowers to dry 
 and you can collect their seeds -- they're viable and ready to sow for more Sundews (see "Propagation" below).

 Feed me, Seymour. 
 Sundews need to eat to survive and grow. They have shallow root systems and get all 
 their nourishment from the insects they capture. Since your carnivorous plant is unlikely to catch flies or other insects in the house, 
 you'll want to feed it. (Isn't that the fun of having this plant, anyway?) 
  
 What Sundews Want 
  
 Your sundew plant loves lots of moisture and flies. Give it what it wants and you'll watch it grow quickly, producing more leaves and flowers. 
  
  
 Keep up the humidity. 
  Native to bogs and marshes, this carnivorous plant prefers higher humidity than is usually found in a home. 
 It's a good idea to place it in a  
 terrarium 
  
 or  
 Wardian case 
  to maintain humidity around it. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
 Sundews are perennials that go dormant in winter and need a cool rest. Keep your plant moist 
 and cool during dormancy, with temperatures between 32-50°F/1-10°C (it will tolerate some frost). 
 Moving it to a garage for the winter may be ideal, just be sure it gets some light. 
 Dying leaves? 
 It is normal for dropped leaves during the winter rest, and Sundew Plant will grow new 
 leaves in spring and summer. Hot temperatures can cause dormancy, so if this happens, don't give up on it. With good 
 care, it should bounce back. This is a temperamental plant that doesn't like extreme heat, 
 direct sunlight or dry conditions, so if it dies don't feel badly. It's a good idea to save the seeds, so you'll have 
 more plants.

 Sundew Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  North America, Northern Europe and North Asia 
 Height: 
 Up to 3 in (8 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light 
 Water: 
 Aim to keep the potting medium evenly moist. Never let it dry out completely. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, you'll want to 
 raise the humidity 
  for your Sundew plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C; In winter, a cold rest is needed 
 32-50°F/1-10°C. It will tolerate a little frost. High heat may cause dormancy, so it's 
 best to maintain normal room temps for it. 
 Soil: 
 Live sphagnum moss or a half-and-half mix of peat moss and horticultural sand 
 Fertilizer: 
 Don't fertilize because it will burn the roots and may kill the plant. Since sundews are unlikely to 
 catch insects in the house, you can feed it dead flies spring through fall.  
 Don't 
 use flies that have 
 been exposed to insecticide because it will damage the plant. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds or division. Collect seeds from flowers that have dried and sow them in peat moss 
 (kept moist at all times). Place the pots in a warm window or under  
 fluorescent lights 
 . 
 Seeds germinate in about 2-4 weeks. To divide, separate new rosettes that form around the parent plant.

 Swedish Ivy 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Plectranthus 
  species 
 Swedish ivy house plants are ideal for beginners. Nearly foolproof, this is one of the easiest types of ivy 
 to grow indoors. In fact, it needs little attention to thrive. 
  
  
  
  
 This bushy plant has thick stems that grow upright at first, then trail over the sides of a container. Put it in 
 a hanging basket to show off its thickly leaved cascading stems. 
 Swedish ivy has rounded leaves that are deeply veined with scalloped edges. 
 P. australis 
 is a variety with solid green foliage. The variegated types are more commonly grown as house plants. 
 You can expect pale lavender or white flowers to appear in spring or summer, but they're not nearly as showy as the foliage. 
 Keep it moist, not soggy. 
 This plant grows best with evenly moist soil during the growing season. Take care not to 
 allow the soil to become soggy, which can cause root rot. If your plant wilts despite regular watering, it is 
 probably suffering from root rot. If this happens, take a few stem cuttings from the healthiest stems and propagate them. 
 Get rid of the parent plant -- it won't recover. Cut back on water in the winter, when growth has slowed. But don't allow it to dry out completely. 
 Pinch and prune. 
 This vigorous grower needs regular pruning to keep it in shape. After the flowers fade, snip 
 off stem tips to encourage branching. You'll get a fuller, bushier plant this way. Propagate the stem tips, if you like. 
 They root easily and you'll have new plants. 
 You can prune your plant back by as much as half at a time -- you won't hurt this robust plant at all. 
 This plant is neither native to Sweden, nor is it a true ivy. 
 It's actually in the Labiatae family, along with mint ( 
 Menthe 
 ) and is 
 fast-spreading when planted in the garden. 
 Many varieties are available. Choose the one you like -- they're all easy to grow. The variegated types 
 of ivy plants are most popular as house plants. 
 'Marginatus' has leaves broadly edged with creamy white. 
 'Variegata' is another type with white variegation.

 How to Grow Sweet Potato Vine 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Ipomoea batatas 
 Mounds of dense, colorful foliage make sweet potato vine a favorite ornamental. They're 
 also fast-growing and practically care-free. 
 A favorite of Southern gardeners, sweet potato plants prefer moist, well-drained soil, warm temps and bright light. Give this easy-care ornamental vine what it wants and it'll reward you with three seasons of colorful foliage. 
  
  
  
  
 Sweet potato leaves offer bold color from spring through fall. You don't need to overwinter -- treat this tender vine as an annual. 
 In addition to the garden-variety green foliage, you'll find an abundance of new cultivars with striking leaf shapes, in a 
 stunning range of colors: lime green, golden yellow, coppery gold with a tinge of red, and rich, purplish-black. 
 Popular cultivars include lime 
 'Marguerite' 
 , dark-purple 
 'Blackie' 
 and purple 
 'Sweet Caroline' 
 . 
 There is one draw-back with this vigorous vine...it has a tendency to take over any space available. It will 
 crowd other plants if you let it. 
 Don't be afraid to cut mature sweet potato vines back as much as needed to keep it under control. And don't throw away those 
 cuttings, either. They'll root easily if you poke them into moist soil. 
 Wondering where to grow sweet potato plant? 
 Its trailing habit makes this ornamental vine ideal for a warm, sunny windowsill. 
 Plant it in a hanging basket -- or a window box -- and let its lush vines spill over the side. Or use it 
 as an underplanting for tall flowers outdoors. 
 Allow it to climb a  
 trellis 
 , if you want. 
 This twining climber makes a gorgeous backdrop for tall, upright plants in contrasting colors. 
  
 Sweet Potato Vine Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Central America 
 Height: 
  Up to 12 in (30 cm) tall; will spread or trail several feet if not cut back 
 Light: 
  Moderate to bright light. Will tolerate some direct sunlight. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist at all times. This fast-growing vine is thirsty and dries out 
 quickly in a container, so check it often. Use a container with drainage holes to 
 prevent soggy soil which can lead to root rot. 
 Humidity: 
  Try to maintain 40% relative humidity or higher. Brown leaf tips are a symptom of dry air. Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter. It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge near your tropical plants, rather than guess. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C). Wait till it's warm, 
 if you move it outside; this tender vine doesn't like the cold and it won't tolerate frost. 
 Soil: 
  All-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly in spring, summer and fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Stem tip cuttings will dependably grow roots. Just stick the cut ends in moist potting mix -- or 
 put them in a glass of water. They'll take root in a few weeks.

 Swiss Cheese Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Monstera deliciosa 
  
 Lush and bold, Swiss Cheese Plant makes a good accent if you have the space. 
 Over several years it can grow several feet tall and its dramatic, perforated leaves to 12 inches (30 cm) long or more, so it 
 needs a bit of elbow room. Keep those leaves dust-free and shiny by 
 gently wiping them with a damp cloth. 
  
  
  
 Swiss Cheese Plant makes a big impression in a room. Give those leaves space to sprawl out. 
  
  
 Monstera Deliciosa's Tropical Beginnings 
  
 This handsome foliage plant is a climber in the wild, scrambling up large trees, anchoring itself with thick 
 aerial roots which also take in moisture and nutrients. You can tuck aerial roots that emerge near its base 
 into the soil and train others to climb a moss pole. 
 Young plants have smooth leaves. But as  
 Monstera deliciosa 
  matures, the leaves develop deeply cut edges and wide slits. In its 
 native jungle habitat, the slashes, holes and cuts in the large leaves help the plant to withstand strong winds 
 and torrential downpours. 
 Because of this plant's tropical nature, it likes higher humidity than is usually found in a home. Use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  to raise the humidity around it. 
  
 Problems and Solutions 
  
 Most problems with 
 Monstera deliciosa 
 will show in its leaves. 
  
 Yellowing lower leaves 
  are a symptom of overwatering. Water thoroughly, then allow soil to dry out a bit before watering again. Use a pot with drainage holes and empty drainage tray. 
 Curled, crispy leaf tips 
 could indicate low humidity or too much fertilizer. Flush soil with clean water to wash away any accumulated fertilizer. Wait a month before feeding again. 
 If they are not getting enough light,  
 large leaves grow without holes and slits 
 . Give the plant moderate to bright light, but not direct sun. 
 Scorched leaves 
  (dry, brown spots) are caused by strong, direct sunlight. 
  
  
 Deliciosa 
  means pleasing, referring to the white spadix flower (shown at right) that develops into edible berries on mature plants 
 grown in tropical Central America. 
 However, Swiss Cheese Plant rarely produces flower and fruit when grown indoors. 
 CAUTION: The leaves of Swiss Cheese Plant are poisonous and can cause severe burning in the mouth if eaten. They can also 
 cause skin irritation, so I'd recommend wearing gloves when handling this plant. 
 Repot in spring when roots have filled the pot. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 This big-leafed plant is sometimes called 
 Split-Leaf Philodendron 
 , but 
 that's a different genus. Look for 
 Monstera deliciosa 
 to be sure you're getting this plant. 
  
 Swiss Cheese Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southern Mexico and Guatemala 
 Height: 
  Up to 10 ft (3 m) tall. 
 Light: 
 Bright light, no direct sun. If leaves on mature plants grow without holes or slits, give the plant more light. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly and allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Keep soil barely moist in winter. 
 Yellowing lower leaves are usually a sign of overwatering. Provide good drainage. 
 Humidity: 
 Average to high (at least 40% relative humidity). See these tips for  
 raising the humidity 
  indoors. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm 65-85°F/18-29°C 
 Soil: 
 Mix 1 part peat moss-based mix and 1 part sand or perlite for good drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced liquid or water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Feed monthly in winter. 
 Propagation: 
 Take growing tip cuttings of a mature plant in spring and insert them into moist peat moss

 Hawaiian Ti Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Cordyline terminalis 
 Ti plant makes a stunning accent, lending a colorful, tropical feel to a sunny room. 
 Its broad leaves grow up to 2 ft (60 cm) long and are carried on upright stems that emerge from a narrow, central stalk. 
 As ti plant grows, it naturally drops its lower leaves, becoming more tree-like with a trunk topped with a cluster 
 of colorful foliage. 
  
  
  
  
 Some ti plants have solid green leaves, but the most popular house plants include varieties 
 with red, pink, cream, orange or copper variegation. In the wild, ti plants will produce pink or yellow flower spikes, but don't expect them 
 when grown indoors. 
 Clean leaves. 
  Wipe leaves gently with a damp cloth or spray with a fine mist of room-temperature water to keep them clean. 
 Cleaning the leaves has another advantage -- it helps to prevent  
 spider mites 
  that love dry conditions. 
 Repot young plants 
  in spring when their roots have filled the container. Move it to a pot only 1-2 inches larger. Be 
 sure to use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent root rot. Older, larger ti plants can be top-dressed instead. 
  
 How to Top Dress: 
  Remove the top 2-3 inches of soil and replace with fresh soil every couple years. Take care not to harm any roots that may be near the surface. 
  
  
 Too tall? Top them. 
  You can control the plant's height by cutting it back. New branches 
 often grow from the base of the plant after pruning. Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems. 
 Many named cultivars are available to choose from, including some with pink, red and orange streaked leaves. 
 'Tricolor' 
  is a common variety with pink, red and cream variegation.  
 'Rededge' 
  has a compact growing 
 habit with red-bordered leaves.  
 'Red Sister' 
  is another popular variety heavily streaked with red. 
  
  
  
 Growing Ti Plant Indoors 
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands 
 Height: 
  3-5 ft (90 cm-1.5 m) indoors 
 Light: 
  Bright, indirect light. Leaves that lose their color and variegation aren't getting enough light. 
 Moving the plant near a window where it gets bright, filtered light is ideal. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall. In winter, allow the top inch (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings. 
 Use rainwater to avoid adding fluoride and chlorine that's often present in tap water. If that's not practical, 
 allow tap water to sit for 24 hours so that the chemicals in it will dissipate. 
 Humidity: 
  Aim to maintain 50-60% relative humidity around ti plant. 
 This tropical native prefers moist air, especially in the hot summer months. Dry air will cause leaf 
 tips to turn brown. Keep ti plant away from drafts and heat/AC vents. A cool-mist room humidifier works best to add humidity around 
 your Cordyline plant. It also loves to be misted. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm (65-85°F/18-29°C) room temperatures. It will tolerate a minimum winter temperature of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Spring through fall, feed every 2 weeks with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by 
 half. Choose one 
 that includes micronutrients -- a magnesium deficiency will cause leaves to turn yellow. In winter, feed monthly. 
 Propagation: 
  These are easy to grow from cuttings. Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root them in moist 
 potting mix. Keep young plants warm and raise the humidity around them.

 Venus Fly Trap 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Dionaea muscipula 
  
 In its native habitat, the Venus Fly Trap plant grows in bogs where it is unable to get the nutrients it needs from the soil. 
 Therefore, it has developed a 
 way to feed from the insects it traps in its leaves. 
  
  
  
 Feed Me? 
  
 This bug-munching plant makes food by photosynthesis, so feeding it insects is not critical for its survival. But isn't that the fun of growing this captivating house plant? 
  
  
 This unusual, carnivorous plant grows in a rosette of broad-winged stems, each with 2 rounded leaves that turn red inside 
 when exposed to sunlight. 
 The leaves are hinged 
 in the middle by a midrib and fringed with interlocking "teeth" to hold in its prey. 
 Inside each leaf are a few sensitive hairs that when touched 
 trigger the leaves to snap shut. The action is quick, 
 and the traps may stay closed for as long as 2 weeks. Then they open 
 again, ready for the next victim.  
 Heh, heh. 
  
  
 Although it's fascinating to watch, try not to get overzealous. It's not a good idea to trigger 
 them too often because the traps will stop responding after only a few times. 
  
 Clusters of white flowers may appear in spring. Pick off the flower stems as soon as you see them because they will use 
 the plant's energy to flower instead of growing traps. 
 Venus Fly Trap is a perennial plant that can be kept from year to year. Understanding its needs for moisture and light will keep it 
 healthy. Never allow the potting medium to dry out, which can be fatal. 
 D. muscipula 
 will go dormant in winter when a cool rest is needed. Keep it barely moist and cool during dormancy, 
 with temperatures between 32-50°F/1-10°C. Moving it to a garage for the winter may be ideal...just be sure it gets some sunlight 
 and the temps don't drop below freezing. 
  
  
 Venus Fly Trap Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  North and South Carolina 
 Height: 
 3-10 in (8-25 cm) 
 Light: 
 Good light is vital to this plant's health. Bright light with 4 hours of direct sun a day is ideal. Sunlight 
 is more important than feeding the plant because it makes most of its food through photosynthesis. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall. In winter, give it just enough water to keep from drying out 
 completely. This plant is sensitive to chemicals in tap water, so it's a good idea to use only distilled or rain water. 
 If stems and leaves become limp, it means that the soil is too dry. Water thoroughly, although the plant may not recover. 
 Humidity: 
 Prefers moderate (around 50% relative humidity) or higher. Use a humidity tray, cool-mist room humidifier, or an open terrarium to maintain moist air around your plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Normal room temperatures (60-75°F/16-24°C); In winter, a near-freezing dormancy period is needed ( 
 32-50°F/1-10°C). 
 Soil: 
 Use nutrient-poor soil because rich potting mix will harm its roots. You can use all sphagnum moss or mix 
 1 part peat moss with 1 part perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Don't fertilize. Fertilizer will burn the roots and may kill the plant. Since it is unlikely to 
 catch insects in the house, you can feed it dead flies 
 occasionally in spring and summer.  
 Don't 
  use flies that have 
 been exposed to insecticide because it will harm the plant. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide rhizomes in spring; can be grown from seed.

 Wandering Jew 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Tradescantia albiflora 
  or  
 Zebrina pendula 
  
  
  
 Best known as a hanging plant, the Wandering Jew house plant is easy and fast-growing. Its long, fleshy stems are densely 
 covered with lance-shaped leaves that are about 2 in (5 cm) long. Small, 3-petaled flowers may appear in spring, but they're 
 not showy. 
 A similar plant goes by the same common name:  
 Zebrina pendula 
 has deep green to purple leaves with two 
 broad bands of silver, and purple undersides. It has the same growing habits and requires the same care. 
 To show it off, display your trailing house plant in a 
 plant hanger 
 , decorative 
 plant sconce 
 or on a 
 plant stand 
 . 
 Pinch and prune. 
 Pinch stems back often to encourage branching and to keep 
 the plant from getting too leggy. 
 The best time to prune is in spring and summer, during the growing season. You can easily propagate the 
 stem cuttings for more plants. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Always prune after a leaf node (the place where a leaf is 
 attached to the stem). Cuts made here will cause the stem to branch out for a fuller, bushier plant. 
  
  
 Watch for pests. 
  
 Aphids 
 are small, greenish insects 
 that are attracted to new growth, which this plant has in abundance. Look for them on the stems of new shoots. Also, 
 watch for webbing between stems and on the undersides of leaves, a tell-tale sign of  
 spider mites 
 . 
 Repot in spring 
 , only when the plant outgrows its pot. Move to one just 1-2 inches larger because a pot that's too big will hold too much water. 
  
 Zebrina pendula is stunning, with shimmering green and purple striped foliage. 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 Several species go by the common name Wandering Jew. Other common names include Inch Plant and Spiderwort. 
 Tradescantia albiflora 
 is one of the most popular. Both 
 'Variegata' and 'Quicksilver' cultivars have white-striped leaves. 
 Zebrina pendula 
 has beautiful green-and-purple striped foliage, glistening with silver. 'Quadricolor' 
 has striped leaves in green, silver, purple and pink. 
  
 Wandering Jew Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
 Trailing stems can grow to 2 ft (60 cm) or more. 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. 
 Long spaces between leaves are caused by too little light. Pinch off leggy stems and move 
 your plant to a brighter spot. Leaves will also lose their variegation if they don't get enough light. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist in the growing season, slightly drier in winter. Stems that look wilted may be a sign of root rot. Cut off any withered stems and allow potting mix to dry out a bit between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40% relative humidity or higher. If leaf tips turn brown, the air is too dry. Increase moisture by using a cool-mist  
 humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C suit this tropical year-round. It will tolerate a winter minimum of 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with 10-10-10 liquid fertilizer diluted by half. Too 
 much fertilizer can cause the leaves to lose their variegation. 
 Propagation: 
 Easy to propagate from stem tip cuttings. Take 3 in (7.5 cm) cuttings in spring or summer and place in moist 
 soil. Cuttings will root in about 3 weeks.

 Watermelon Peperomia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Peperomia argyreia 
 Small, yet dramatic -- that's Watermelon Peperomia. Its silvery striped leaves complement other houseplants and they stand pretty well on their own, too. 
  
  
  
  
 This rain forest native-turned-houseplant has an easy-care nature. Watermelon Peperomia is eye-catching, too, making it a popular indoor plant for several decades. 
 It's long-lasting and usually trouble-free. Any problems are usually related to watering. 
 Wilted leaves 
  typically indicate a plant is thirsty. However, this slow-growing plant will wilt from root rot, caused by over-watering. Roots need air, too. Use a pot with drainage holes. If you want to cover a plain nursery pot, slip it into a cachepot -- a decorative pot without drainage holes. I put small rocks in the bottom of cachepots to hold the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Repot in spring 
  only when you see roots pushing up through the soil, or growing out of the drainage holes. 
 Peperomia argyreia 
  is slow-growing and grows best in a small pot. Soil can become compact over time, so it will benefit from repotting every couple years, just to refresh the soil. When repotting, don't pack down the soil -- keep it loose. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Wet, peaty potting mixes can attract  
 fungus gnats 
 . They look like tiny black flies that hop or crawl on the soil. Sometimes fungus gnats arrive with a plant from the garden center, or come with a bag of moist potting mix. Treat an infestation right away because these pests will multiply quickly and move on to your other indoor plants. 
  
  
 Watermelon Peperomia Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
 Brazil 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 in (25 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light, but no direct sun. Small leaves or leggy stems indicate the plant is not getting enough light. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, then allow the top 2 in (5 cm) to dry out before watering again. One of the few things that bother Peperomias is soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. If you believe you've hopelessly over-watered, ease the plant out of its pot and take a peek at its roots. If they're soft, brown and mushy, toss it out; it won't recover. If the roots are firm and white, repot right away in fresh potting mix. Water sparingly in winter, when growth is slower. Always water your houseplants with lukewarm water because cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim to maintain at least 50% relative humidity around Watermelon Peperomia. Set the plant on a tray of wet pebbles or use a 
 cool-mist humidifier 
 . Brown leaf tips are a sign of dry air. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). This South American native doesn't like fluctuating temperatures; keep it away from heat/AC vents and cold blasts from doors and windows. 
 Cold air may cause its leaves to fall off. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite for faster drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal for growing Peperomias indoors. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Peperomia argyreia is not a heavy feeder. Because it's slow-growing, too much fertilizer can burn its roots. Feed once a month spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended strength. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem tip cuttings in spring and early summer. It roots easily in moist perlite or potting mix.

 Weeping Fig 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Ficus benjamina 
  
 Weeping fig is the most popular indoor tree from the Moraceae family. 
 Its branches droop downward from woody stems, covered with glossy, pointed 2-4 in (5-10 cm) leaves which become darker 
 green as the plant ages. 
  
  
  
 Give beautiful Weeping Fig lots of bright, indirect sunlight year-round. 
  
 Ficus Benjamina 
  Varieties 
  
 This fig tree makes a statement in any brightly lit room. Growers sometimes braid its trunks for a decorative topiary look. 
 Some nurseries offer fancy cultivars of this popular house plant: 
 F. benjamina 
  
 'Indigo' 
 and 
 'Midnight' 
 have dark-green, glossy leaves. 
 'Monique' 
 has wavy leaves. 
 A few of the many variegated cultivars include 
 'Starlight' 
 with dark-green leaves edged in creamy white... 
 'Silver Cloud' 
 delicately edged with white...and 
 'Variegata' 
 broadly variegated with creamy yellow. 
  
 Get to Know Your Weeping Fig Tree 
  
 These ficus trees are slow-growing, but can grow to 10 ft indoors. Dwarf varieties only reach 3 ft (90 cm) tall. You can 
 prune tall branches to control the plant's height. 
 Some  
 Ficus 
  species are popular to grow as bonsai trees. 
  
 Watering tip: 
  Weeping fig tree is sensitive to chlorine, fluoride, and other chemicals often found in tap water, as well as the salt in softened water. Use only distilled or filtered water, or allow tap water to sit overnight so the chemicals will dissipate. 
  
  
 To repot...or not. 
 Ficus plants like to be slightly pot-bound. 
 And because this tree is slow-growing, 
 repotting is only needed every 3-4 years. 
 The best time to repot is in spring before new growth begins, using 
 a pot only 1-2 inches larger. 
  
  
 Breathe Easier. 
  
 Weeping fig is one of the best plants for improving air quality indoors. It has one of the top removal rates of toxins 
 like formaldehyde, benzene and trichloroethylene from tainted indoor air. 
 Dropped leaves?  
 This is a plant that doesn't like change. 
 Place your ficus in bright, indirect light and leave it there. 
 It's known to drop its leaves when moved around. Keep it away from drafts. Blasts of hot or cold air from 
 doorways or vents will also cause leaf drop. If this happens, don't worry. With good care it will grow new 
 leaves in spring and summer. 
 In early fall, expect it to drop quite a few leaves. This is normal. You can help prevent the tree from 
 losing too many leaves by misting it to increase humidity. If your home is as dry as mine in fall and winter, you'll probably want to use a room humidifier to raise the moisture around it. Also, don't be tempted to overwater a shedding plant, 
 which makes the problem worse. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
   
 Scale insects 
  may infest fig trees. They're small and brown, often found on the stems and undersides of leaves. Treat any infestation right away. 
 Weeping fig is a long-lived house plant. Give it what it wants and you'll enjoy it for many, many years. 
  
 Weeping Fig Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia and Northern Australia 
 Height: 
  Up to 10 ft (3 m); dwarf cultivars will reach about 3 ft (90 cm). 
 Light: 
  Bright, indirect light year-round. Trees that don't grow much, are dropping leaves, or lose their variegation, probably aren't getting enough light. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, then allow to dry out slightly between waterings. This plant will not tolerate soggy soil. 
 Keep soil slightly drier in winter, when light levels are lower and growth is slower. Yellow leaves are a symptom of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high. If the relative humidity drops below 40%, you'll want to 
 raise the humidity 
  for your plant; the most efficient way is with a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperatures (65-85°F/18-29°C). Weeping fig will tolerate a minimum of 50°F/10°C. Keep your plant away from drafts and heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
  Soilless potting mix or any that drains well. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once a month spring through fall with a balanced liquid or water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. Or drop time-release fertilizer granules on top of the potting medium before watering. Don't feed weeping fig in winter when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
 Take tip cuttings in spring.

 Windmill Palm Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Trachycarpus fortunei 
  
  
  
  
 Windmill palm tree is one of the most adaptable palms you can grow. This tree is a giant in its native 
 habitat, but only reaches 6-8 ft when grown in a container indoors. Slow-growing, it will take this indoor palm 
 plant several years to reach this height. 
 The whorl of fan-shaped fronds make it a stunning decorative accent tree. Young fronds have pleated leaflets 
 that gradually open into widely spaced fans. 
 As the palm grows, it develops a thick trunk which is covered with coarse brown fibers. 
  
 Shed some light 
 . Give this palm as much light as you can. Move it outdoors for the summer, if you want. 
 Just be sure to keep it protected from strong winds, which can damage the fronds. A sheltered porch or patio is ideal. 
 Repot in spring 
 every 2-3 years or as needed, moving it to a pot 1 size larger. Older plants that are too big 
 to repot can be top-dressed instead by replacing the top couple inches of soil. Crowding roots helps to control its size. 
 Use a heavy container to prevent it from toppling because this palm gets top-heavy. 
 Brown leaf tips 
 are often caused by sporadic watering, low humidity or a build-up of chemicals in tap water 
 and fertilizers. It's a good idea to water palms with distilled, filtered or rain water. 
  
 Palms are sensitive to fluoride and chlorine often found in tap water, and salts from fertilizer.  
 You can get rid of these impurities in the soil by flushing the container. It's easy to do: Pour lots 
 of water over the soil so that the water comes out the drainage holes. Repeat the process a couple more 
 times, then empty the drainage tray. 
  
  
 Buying a palm? 
 Windmill Palm Tree sometimes goes by the common names Chusan Palm or Fortune Palm. 
 Look for the botanical name 
 Trachycarpus fortunei 
 to be sure you're getting this indoor palm plant. 
  
  
 Windmill Palm Tree Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia 
 Height: 
  Up to 8 ft (2.4 m) indoors 
 Light: 
  Bright light with plenty of direct sun. 
 Moving your palm outdoors? Make the move a gradual one. Palms that go into hot, 
 direct summer sun then back to indirect light indoors may drop their leaflets. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil moist spring through summer and barely moist in fall and winter. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate (at least 50% relative humidity).  
 Dry air will cause the tips of the leaflets to turn brown and crispy. 
 Mist your palm regularly or use a  
 room humidifier 
  to add moisture to the air around it. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperature 65-75°F/18-24°C year-round. This is one of the few 
 "indoor palms" that can tolerate cold. Windmill palm loves warmth, but will tolerate a minimum of 40°F/4°C. 
 Soil: 
 Use a peaty mix that drains well. Mix 1 part sand to 3 parts African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed once in spring and again in summer with a time-release fertilizer. Rose fertilizer works well 
 because it provides the micronutrients this palm needs. A shortage of magnesium will cause yellow spots on the leaflets. 
 Propagation: 
 Plants can be grown from seeds, but seedlings are slow-growing and you'll wait several years for 
 them to grow into trees.

 Zebra Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Aphelandra squarrosa 
  
  
  
  
 Zebra Plant has exotic, emerald green leaves with dramatic white veins so striking, it is grown for its foliage. 
 Plumes of bright yellow flowers emerging from golden bracts in fall are an added attraction. The flowers will only last a few days, 
 but the bracts will stay for about 6 weeks. 
  
  
 Cut off the bracts after they deteriorate. 
 Aphelandra squarrosa 
 will often bloom a second time during the 
 year when given enough light. 
 Zebra Plants are often forced into bloom in winter and sold while they're flowering. However, they naturally bloom 
 in spring and fall. Unlike some flowering plants, these tropicals are triggered into bloom by the intensity of light rather than day length. 
 Put your plant in a bright location, but keep it out of direct sunlight or you may see its leaves curl up or wrinkle. 
  
 Zebra Plant Pruning, Potting and Potential Problems 
  
 Prune it back. Zebra plants will get leggy over time. Plants that have 
 flowered should be cut down in spring. Cut the main stem, leaving a pair of its lower leaves. 
 In the wild, Zebra plant thrives in the high humidity and frequent downpours of the rain forest. It will thrive indoors, too,  
 as long as its need for high humidity is met. A cool mist room humidifier is the most effective way to increase moisture in the air. 
 Or you can stand the pot on a tray of wet pebbles to raise humidity around the plant. 
 Don't be in a hurry to repot.  
 Aphelandra squarrosa 
 prefers to be slightly pot-bound and blooms best this way. 
 Keep it in a smallish pot. Repot in spring when needed to refresh the soil. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, slip it into a  
 cachepot 
  -- a decorative planter without drainage holes. I put small river rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inside pot above the drainage water. 
 Wipe leaves often with a damp cloth to keep them glossy and dust-free. 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 There are a few cultivars to choose from. 'Louisae' is a prolific bloomer and the tallest, reaching 2 ft... 
 'Dania' is the most common, shorter and more compact. 
 'Apollo' has more pronounced white veins... and 'Red Apollo' has a blush of red on the stems and undersides 
 of its leaves. 
  
 Zebra Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  1-2 ft (30-60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light but no direct sun. Wrinkled or curled leaves indicate it is getting too much light. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist year-round. Dry soil will cause leaves to wilt or drop off. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (aim for 50% relative humidity or higher). Take a look at these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical houseplants. Brown leaf tips are a symptom of dry air. 
 Temperature: 
 Warm 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based potting mix with added perlite to keep the mix light and free-draining. African violet mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring and summer with a water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-inch (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. Cut the stem just below a  
 node 
 -- 
 the place where a leaf is attached to the main stem. Dip cut ends in  
 rooting hormone powder 
  
 then insert them in seed starting mix or perlite. Enclose the potted cuttings in clear plastic or use a 
 glass cloche 
 to hold in humidity. Set the covered 
 cuttings where they'll get indirect light. Water when the potting medium appears to dry out. After 3 weeks, 
 you can remove the covering. Gradually expose the cuttings to more light. You should see new growth in about 6 weeks.

 ZZ Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Zamioculcas zamiifolia 
  
 ZZ Plant has become increasingly popular in recent years and I believe it deserves all the attention it's been getting. 
  
  
  
 Give ZZ indirect light and infrequent watering. 
  
 The Aroid family has given us more dependable house plants than any other group and 
 Zamioculcas 
  
 zamiifolia 
 is no exception. 
 This is the only species in the 
  
 Zamioculcas 
 genus, and 
 worth adding to your collection. 
 ZZ makes a great room accent and practically thrives on neglect. This easy-going houseplant is forgiving if you forget 
 to water, tolerates low light, and rarely needs fertilized. Want more? It also seems to shrug off pests. 
  
 Growing from rhizomes, it has thick, upright stems bearing narrow, dark-green glossy leaves. Keep the leaves clean by 
 gently wiping them with a damp cloth.  
 Don't use leaf shine products 
 , which can damage the foliage. 
 A slow-grower indoors, ZZ rarely needs repotted. Eventually it will become over-crowded and need a bigger pot. It's best to repot in spring, when new growth begins. Use a small pot (no more than 2 inches (5 cm) wider than the 
 old pot) with drainage holes. 
 Overwatering is a sure-fire way to kill it.  
 Z. zamiifolia 
 is an African native, surviving drought by storing water in its thick rhizomes and semi-succulent stems. To avoid soggy soil, use a fast-draining mix. You can add sand or perlite to a 
 potting mix or use a cactus mix. 
  
 ZZ Plant Flower 
  
 Small, insignificant flowers -- consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe -- may appear at the base of plants in 
 summer, although ZZs rarely flower indoors. 
  
 Watering Tip: 
  Despite being drought-tolerant, your ZZ will be healthiest with regular watering. Water thoroughly then allow potting medium to dry out a bit before watering again. 
  
  
 CAUTION: All parts of 
 Zamioculcas zamiifolia 
 are poisonous. Keep it away from children and pets who may play with or ingest this plant. 
  
 ZZ Plant Problems and Solutions at a Glance 
  
 Are your ZZ plant leaves turning yellow? 
  You overwatered. Unfortunately, your poor plant is already suffering. The rhizomes are likely rotted in the soggy potting mix. Are the stems soft and mushy? It's time to replace your plant; it won't recover. 
 Dropped leaves?  
 You forgot to water 
 . Yes, I know I say to allow it to dry out between waterings, but it won't survive without a drop to drink. Shedding leaves helps the plant survive during a drought in its native habitat. 
 Brown leaves? 
  Too much sun. ZZ plant will tolerate bright, indirect light to low light -- and everything in between. Dry, brown spots will develop on its leaves if you left your plant in hot, sunny window. 
 Plant not growing? 
  That's typical. It grows s-l-o-w-l-y, so you won't see much change in it.  
 Ever 
 . If you like a houseplant that you can virtually treat as décor, the ZZ is for you. It's a beautiful accent plant you'll enjoy for many years.

 ZZ Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  East Africa 
 Height: 
  Slow-growing, but can reach up to 3 ft (90 cm) indoors, confined to a pot. It grows much taller in its native habitat. 
 Light: 
  You'll get the best growth and healthiest plant by keeping it in bright, indirect sunlight, though it will tolerate low light. Morning sun is fine, but keep it out of hot, direct sunlight which can scorch its leaves. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly then allow the top 2 in (5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. Soggy soil will cause the rhizomes to rot. Yellow foliage and soft stems are also a sign of too much water. 
 Although ZZ plant will tolerate dry soil, it will likely drop its leaves if left too dry, too long. 
 Humidity: 
  Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). If air is extremely dry, use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C year-round. 
 Soil: 
  Fast-draining medium works best to avoid root rot. Mix 1 part good-quality all-purpose potting mix and 1 part horticultural 
 sand or perlite. Cactus potting mix works well, too. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed 4 times a year with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half. It's a good idea to feed at the time of watering to avoid fertilizer burn. 
 Propagation: 
 Division of rhizomes. Leaf cuttings can be propagated. Just pull a leaf off the stem and stick 
 the cut end in moist potting medium. Don't bury the leaf too deep or it will rot. Be patient -- the cuttings can take several 
 months to take root and grow. New plantlets will grow around the leaf.

 How to Care for Achimenes Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Achimenes 
  Spp. and Hybrids 
 Show off your flowering plant in a hanging basket -- you'll enjoy showers of beautiful blooms from late spring till fall.

 Achimenes 
  is in the  
 Gesneriaceae 
  family, along with other showy favorites 
 African Violet 
 ,  
 Gloxinia  
 and  
 Lipstick Plant 
 . 
 Some common names for this plant are Cupid's Bower, Hot Water Plant, or Magic Flower. 
  
 How it became known as Hot Water Plant: 
 Rhizomes can be started 
 into growth by dipping them in hot water before planting. The hot water bath isn't necessary,  
 but this is where it got the name. 
  
  
 Dozens of hybrids are available to choose from, offering an abundance of red, pink, white, purple, violet-blue 
 or yellow flowers. Some hybrids have contrasting striped throats. 
 Achimenes erecta 
 is a popular variety. Despite its name, this plant has a trailing 
 habit -- growing to 18 in (45 cm) -- with bright red flowers. 
 A. longiflora 
 trails up to 2 ft (60 cm) long, and has big, blue flowers with a white throat.  
 A.l. 'Alba' 
 and 
 A.l. 'Ambroise Verschaffelt' 
 both feature white flowers with purple 
 lines down the throat. 
 Flowers appear on short stems that grow from the leaf axils. The tubular flowers grow up to 2 in (5 cm) long, 
 and flare out into 5-petaled trumpets, up to 3 in (8 cm) wide. Each  
 Achimenes 
  flower lasts just a few days, but you'll 
 enjoy continuous blooms for several months. 
  
 Deep-green, velvety leaves are carried in pairs, and can grow up to 3 in (8 cm) long with sawtoothed edges. 
 The long stems are weak -- causing them to cascade over the edge of the pot. Show off those trailing blooms by displaying it on a  
 plant stand 
 . Those gorgeous blooms make a stunning accent to any brightly lit room. 
  
 Dozens of varieties are available, including the purple-throated flowers shown here. 
  
 Year-Round Care 
  
 Flower buds dropping? 
 Dry soil, dry air and extreme temps may cause buds and flowers to fall off. 
 Keep the soil lightly moist while  
 Achimenes 
  is actively growing. 
 Dry soil will also trigger the plant to go dormant. Indoor air can become extremely dry; fortunately, boosting humidity around your tropical plant is easy. Use a humidity tray or a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Pinch your plant. 
  Pinch stem tips when they are about 3-in (7.5 cm) long to promote branching. You'll get a fuller plant -- and more blooms -- this way. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Wet, peaty potting mixes sometimes attract  
 fungus gnats 
 . And  
 aphids 
 may attack new growth; check the along the stems and new leaves for these pests. Treat any infestation right away to prevent them from multiplying and invading your other indoor plants. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
   
 Achimenes 
  will go dormant in the winter. When flowering tapers off in fall, reduce 
 watering and allow the plant to die back naturally. Cut off brown, withered stems at soil level with sharp pruners -- don't pull them 
 off with your hands because that may damage the rhizomes. Take rhizomes out of the pot and store them in a paper bag, 
 in a cool (60°F/16°C), dry place until spring. 
 Repot every spring. 
 Pot the dormant rhizomes in fresh potting mix (see  
 Soil 
  below), planting 
 them 1 in (2.5 cm) deep, about 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Keep the mix lightly moist at all times. 
  
 Achimenes Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Central America 
 Height: 
 1-2 ft (30-60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Set your plant where it'll get plenty of bright, indirect sunlight. Protect your plant from hot midday sun, which may cause brown scorch marks on the tender leaves. 
 Filtered light 
 from a south- or west-facing window will give it the light it needs. Don't have a sunny window? 
 Achimenes 
  also responds well to artificial light. Set plant about 8 to 10 inches under a  
 fluorescent light 
  for 12 hours a day.  
 Switch off the lights at night -- these beauties need their rest, too. Some flowering plants won't set buds unless they get 12 hours of continuous darkness. 
 It's a good idea to use a timer to come on the same time every day. 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil evenly moist during the growing season, but not soggy which will quickly cause the rhizomes to rot. If the medium is allowed to dry out, the plant will go dormant. 
 Don't water in winter. (See "Give it a winter rest" above.) Always use room-temperature water because cold water is a shock to this tropical native. 
 Humidity: 
  Try to maintain at least 40-50% relative humidity around your plant. The best way to raise humidity around your houseplant is by setting the plant on a  
 humidity tray or near a cool-mist room humidifier 
 . Don't mist  
 Achimenes 
  because its soft, fuzzy leaves will trap water, causing dark spots on the leaves and fungus. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperature 65-75°F/18-24°C;  
 Achimenes 
  will tolerate temps as low as 55°F/12°C, 
 but anything above 80°F/25°C will cause flower buds to shrivel and dry up. 
 Soil: 
  Use 3 parts peat moss-based potting medium and 1 part perlite and/or vermiculite. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks while plants are budding and blooming with high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer diluted to 1/4 strength. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in early summer. Or cut rhizome into pieces and pot separately. Achimenes rhizomes are small, so don't be afraid to crowd them a bit for a full, lush container. Plant rhizomes 2 in (5 cm) apart, covering them with 
 1 in (2.5 cm) potting mix. 
  
 Keep potted rhizomes lightly moist and warm (around 70-75°F/21-24°C) until you see new growth, then resume normal care. 
 Spring is a good time to divide rhizomes. 
 Discard any rhizomes that are small or shriveled -- they're not worth repotting.

 African Lily Flower 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Agapanthus africanus 
 Showy blue flower clusters topping the tall stems of African lily have 
 captured gardeners' hearts for years. But did you know that you can grow this dazzling beauty indoors? 
 African lilies grow wonderfully in containers. 
  
  
  
 Agapanthus gets its name from the Greek words agape meaning love and anthos meaning flower. 
  
 Give your plant plenty of light. Some full sun is needed to make this beauty bloom. And when it does -- 
 several flower stems will burst with clouds of blue-hued blossoms all summer. This garden favorite makes an ideal 
 potted plant for the sunroom or any room that gets full sunlight. Turn the pot each week to give each 
 side even light exposure. 
  
 Caring for African Lilies Year-Round 
  
 Pot 'em up. 
 Each plant sends up several leafless flower stems, surrounded by a fountain of long, sword-shaped leaves and needs room to grow. Plant rhizomes 1-inch (2.5 cm) deep. It's best to plant one per pot because plants eventually spread out at least 1 ft (30 cm) wide. 
 Repot in spring 
  only when necessary. This flowering plant blooms best when pot-bound, so keep the 
 fleshy rhizome roots crowded in the container. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Overwinter  
 A. africanus 
  in a sunny window. Cut back on watering, but don't allow the soil to dry 
 out. Stop fertilizing after flowering is over. In early spring, resume normal care. 
 If you've never grown African lilies, give them a try. Growing these tender perennials indoors is easy and, with 
 good care, you'll enjoy their gorgeous flowers year after year.

 African Lily Buying Tips 
  
 You'll find 
 Agapanthus africanus 
 for sale in spring and summer in garden centers and nearly year-round 
 at some online nurseries. 
 Though most are blue, one cultivar 'Albus' is pure white. A dwarf variety exists -- 'Peter Pan' only 
 reaches about 10 inches (25 cm) tall. 
  
  
  
  
 African Lily Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 2-3 ft (60-90 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 African lilies thrive in full sunlight. If you don't get many blooms, move your plant to a sunnier location. Moving African lily outdoors for the summer will give it the sunlight it needs. 
 Water: 
  Water generously throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist. 
 Water sparingly after flowering is finished. It's a good idea to use a pot with drainage holes because African Lily won't tolerate soggy soil. Yellow leaves are usually a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity. Use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  for best results. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C. If you scoot your container to 
 the patio or porch for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. But bring it back indoors when the temperature 
 drops...these tender perennials will only tolerate temps as low as 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly in spring and summer with a high-phosphorous water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Divide plants in spring every 4 years or when they get too crowded. Sow African lily seeds in spring. 
 Plants grown from seed may take 2 to 3 years to flower.

 How to Grow African Violet Plants 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Saintpaulia 
  hybrids 
 Dependable bloomers, African violet plants top any list of favorite flowering houseplants. 
  
  
  
 With countless varieties to choose from,  it's easy to see why African violets are irresistible. 
  
 Dainty African violets form a low-growing rosette of dark-green, rounded leaves. Flowers rise above the leaves on fleshy 
 stems and are available in a range of colors from white, pink or red, to all shades 
 of violet-blue and purple, as well as bicolors. 
 These popular flowers are easy to find in nurseries and florist shops. You'll find many more varieties available 
 if you order African violets online. 
 Thousands of cultivars have been introduced, providing us with some spectacular new choices. Flowers may be single, double, edged 
 with white, or have large, frilly petals. There are also trailing, miniature and micro varieties. 
 Choose the one you like. 
 Looking for minis?  
 'Little Delight' 
  is a miniature hybrid with white blooms edged in purple. Petite  
 'Love Bug' 
 has crimson semi-double flowers. 
  
 Find a spot for them that provides bright, indirect light and you'll enjoy living bouquets for months on end. 
 Give your African violet at least 10 hours of bright, indirect light each day for more blooming power. 
  
 Given enough light, you can expect African violet plants to bloom almost year-round. 
  
 Caring for African Violet Plants 
  
  
 They can be damaged by overwatering, cold drafts, or harsh summer sun, but otherwise caring for African violets is easy. 
 Keeping the soil moist, giving it plenty of bright, indirect light, and regular feedings will help it to stay healthy and blooming. 
 Brown leaves? 
  Older leaves will shrivel and turn brown. This is normal. Cut them off because they can attract fungus. 
 Wondering whether to repot...or not? 
  African violet plants prefer to be slightly pot-bound, and bloom best this way, so repotting is usually needed only to refresh the soil. As a rule of thumb, 
 African violet pots should be about half as wide as the plant. 
 Careful with that water! 
  
 Avoid getting the velvety leaves of African violets wet. 
 Cold water, especially, will leave spots on the leaves and they won't come off. 
 If the leaves need to be cleaned, brush them gently with a soft, dry brush, such as a small paintbrush. 
  
 Easy care and endless varieties make African Violets ever-popular to grow as house plants. 
  
 No blooms? 
  Your plant probably isn't getting enough light. In the short days of winter, put it under an artificial light to coax more flowers. There's no reason why African violet plants won't bloom all year. 
 Deadhead spent flowers. 
  You'll get more blooms this way. Also remove any dead or damaged leaves to keep it healthy and looking its finest. 
 Gray, fluffy mold 
  is likely  
 botrytis 
 , a fungus that thrives on 
 dead flowers or leaves, especially in humid conditions. Cut off any affected areas and treat right away. Keeping your plant warm, with good air circulation will help prevent it. 
 Watch for pests. 
   
 Fungus gnats 
  are attracted to wet, peaty potting mixes. They look like tiny, black flies. However, they don't fly -- you'll see them crawling, or perhaps hopping on the soil. Treat any infestation right away because they multiply quickly and may move on to your other indoor plants. 
  
 African Violet Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Eastern Africa 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 in (15 cm) 
 Light: 
  Needs bright light to bloom. 
 Leggy 
 stems and no blooms indicate that it's not getting enough light. 
 Some direct sun in winter is fine, but strong summer sun will scorch African violet 
 leaves. Turn the plant each week to ensure even exposure to sunlight; otherwise, plants will lean toward the light source. It grows well under  
 fluorescent light 
 . Set the plants about 6 inches (15 cm) beneath lights for 14 to 16 hours a day.  
 African violets may also fail to bloom if they don't get 
 8 hours of darkness each night. (These beauties need their rest, too.) 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist, but not soggy. It's best to water plant from the bottom to avoid stem rot. Bottom-watering helps to prevent getting water on the leaves, which causes brown spots. 
 Remember to always use room-temperature water when watering your houseplants because cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high; aim for 50-60% relative humidity. It's a good idea to use a  
 humidity gauge 
 rather than guess because levels can drop drastically in winter. Set plant on a tray of wet pebbles or use a cool-mist room humidifier to raise the humidity around it. Do not mist because the water can damage leaves. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C year-round. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based with added perlite and/or vermiculite, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks with a high-phosphorus fertilizer, such as African violet fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) leaf stem cuttings in spring or summer. Dip the cut end in water, then 
 dip it in  
 rooting hormone powder 
 . Poke the stem into moist potting mix. Use your fingers to firm the mix around the 
 stem so that it stands up. Enclose the pot in a glass cloche or terrarium to hold in moisture. Keep the cutting out of direct sunlight. 
 Leaves should develop roots in about a month, and you should see plantlets form from the base of the cutting in about 
 another month after that.

 Air Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Tillandsia ionantha 
 and other  
 Tillandsia 
  species 
  
  
  
 Air plant is  
 epiphytic 
 , meaning that it lives by absorbing water and nutrients through its leaves, rather 
 than from soil. 
 In its native Central and South America,  
 Tillandsia  
 grows on trees, using its small roots to anchor itself on a tree 
 branch. Because of its aerial lifestyle in the tropics, this type of epiphyte should not be planted in ordinary 
 potting mix which will cause its small roots to rot. 
 Air plants can be grown in crevices or depressions of a gnarled piece of wood, wired onto a twig wreath 
 with enameled florists' wire, or tucked into a seashell. Put the plant's roots on sphagnum moss to 
 keep them from drying out. Do not use treated wood, or driftwood that may contain sea salt. 
  
 Small terrarium cases, shown here, make an easy home for Tillandsia ionantha. 
  
 These rootless wonders allow many creative possibilities for how to grow them.  
 Stylish  
 Tillandsia 
  arrangements are 
 sure to grab attention wherever you display them. I'm loving mine. 
  
 This tropical house plant from the Bromeliad family grows in a rosette of arching thin, green leaves, with deep 
 pink or red plume-like bracts, and violet-blue flowers that appear in summer. 
 No blooms? 
   
 Tillandsias 
  that don't bloom are likely just too young. You can 
 expect your plant to bloom when mature, which can take about 3 years. Another reason for no 
 flowers is lack of sufficient light. Move your air plant to a brighter location, but avoid hot, direct 
 sun which can scorch the foliage. 
  
 Grow Tillandsia ionantha on a piece of wood, just like its native habitat. 
  
 Air plants love air. Big surprise. Putting them in a spot where they'll get good air circulation allows 
 the leaves to dry between waterings, just as they would in the wild. An open window (when it's warm) or a ceiling 
 fan can help. 
 Tillandsia 
 only lives for about 5 years, then deteriorates after blooming. However, it grows offsets 
 -- called  
 pups 
 -- around the parent plant. Leave these pups attached until they are about half 
 the size of the parent plant. Propagating pups will give you an ongoing collection of beautiful plants.

 Air Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Central and South America 
 Height: 
 6-12 in (15-30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. These tropical beauties also thrive 
 under fluorescent lights, making them good office plants. 
 Water: 
 Spray plants twice a week, until they are thoroughly wet. Or you can take them to the sink and run tepid water 
 over them. DO NOT soak them. Turn plants upside down to allow excess water to run off. Standing water at the base of the 
 leaves will cause them to rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high -- 50% relative humidity or above. Brown leaf tips are caused by dry air. Use a humidity tray,  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  or mist the plants with tepid water. 
 Temperature: 
 Spring through early fall, average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C. 
 In winter, a cool rest 60°F/16°C will help it bloom the following summer. 
 Soil: 
 None needed 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once a month with foliar fertilizer 
 specially made for air plants. 
 Propagation: 
  Detach offsets when they reach half the size of the parent plant 
 .

 Amaryllis Care Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Hippeastrum 
 spp. 
 Wondering about amaryllis care? Growing amaryllis indoors 
 is easy to do by forcing the bulbs into bloom mid-winter.  
 Popular for their festive, oversized flowers, amaryllis bulbs are commonly sold as ready-to-plant kits for the Christmas season. 
 These bulbs produce magnificent trumpet-shaped blooms in red, white, yellow, pink, and salmon. In addition to solid-colored petals, 
 there are many varieties with stripes, contrasting edges -- even double blooms. A single stem will produce 4 flowers, and large bulbs may produce 2 stems. 
  
  
  
 Festive Amaryllis puts on a spectacular Christmas show. 
  
 Amaryllis Bulb Buying Tips 
  
 Buy bulbs early in the season for best quality and best selection. Choose bulbs that are plump and firm. Don't buy shriveled bulbs even if they're a "bargain"...they may not grow well. 
 You'll find an excellent variety from online nurseries. Many cultivars are available to choose from. Pink and white  
 'Apple Blossom' 
 is long-time favorite.  
 Red-and-white 
 'Minerva' 
 is a popular holiday selection. 
 'Red Lion' 
 is a dependable bloomer in rich, radiant red. 
  
 Potted amaryllis is easy to grow indoors in time for Christmas. 
  
 Steps to Forcing Amaryllis Bulbs 
  
 Plant the bulb in a pot that's just big enough to hold it, with the top third of the bulb above the soil line. 
 Water and set it in bright light, in a cool (around 60°F/16°C) place. To prevent rot, water sparingly until the flower stem appears, then increase 
 water. Check it often because flowering plants are thirsty. 
 When a 6-inch/15 cm stem appears, move the potted bulb to a sunlit spot. 
 You can expect blooms 6-8 weeks after planting. The long, strap-like leaves will appear long after the stems are grown. 
 Blooms will last for several weeks if kept at 
 a maximum of 65°F/18°C. 
  
 What to Do After the Bloom 
  
 After the flowers fade, cut off the stems and let the leaves grow to nourish the bulb. Continue to water and fertilize the plant. 
 Gradually reduce watering so that the leaves die back. Cut off the brown leaves. Allow the bulb to rest by storing it in a paper bag 
 in a cool (50°F/10°C), dry place for at least 2 months. Plant it again in fresh soil 6-8 weeks before you want it to bloom. 
 Good amaryllis care will ensure that you'll enjoy beautiful blooms year after year. 
  
 Candy cane-colored blooms make this amaryllis a holiday favorite. 
  
 Amaryllis Care Tips 
  
 Growing amaryllis in a bright window. 
  
 Origin: 
 South America 
 Height: 
 12-24 in (30-60 cm). Use support stakes to hold up tall stems. 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun during growing season. Turn pot occasionally so that all sides are exposed to light for even growth. 
 Water: 
 Keep potting mix evenly moist, but not soggy, during growing season. 
 Humidity: 
 This tropical native will tolerate average room humidity (around 40% relative humidity). Keep your plant away of drafts from 
 heating vents and cold blasts from doors and windows. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average room temperatures 55-70°F/13-21°C throughout the year. 
 Make your flowers last longer by keeping your blooming amaryllis in a slightly cool location. 
 Soil: 
 Any good-quality potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks while amaryllis is growing, with half-strength, high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Offsets may grow around the bulb. Leave them attached for 2 seasons before breaking them off and planting them in their own pots.

 Amazon Lily 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Eucharis x grandiflora 
  
  
  
 Amazon Lily is often overlooked as a house plant. However, just like other members of the Amaryllis family, 
 this tropical flowering plant thrives indoors. 
  
 Amazon lilies thrive in bright locations, shaded from direct sun. 
  
 About Amazon Lily 
  
 This evergreen hybrid has deeply veined, glossy leaves that grow up to 1 ft (30 cm) long. 
 It's a beautiful plant even when not in bloom. But the star-shaped, snowy-white flowers that appear in summer are 
 a sight to behold -- and fragrant, too. 
 Amazon Lily flowers resemble narcissus, featuring a cup in the center of each bloom, 
 tinged with green. The flowers are about 3 in (8 cm) wide and grow in clusters on thick, upright stems that may 
 need staking to hold them up. You can expect 3 or more flowers per stem. 
  
 Take a Stand 
  
 Running out of space for your house plants?  
 Indoor plant stands 
  may be just the solution. Take a look at these new ways to display your indoor plants. 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
  every 3 years or when it's practically bursting out of its pot. This lily thrives in a small container and 
 blooms best when pot-bound. Just be sure to use one with drainage holes to prevent overwatering. Remove 
 offset bulbs at this time and pot them separately. 
 Give it a rest. 
 After blooming, cut back on water to allow the bulb to dry out and 
 stop fertilizing till spring. Then resume with normal care. Sometimes the plant will bloom a second time in fall 
 or winter. If not, you can expect it to rebloom the following summer. 
 If you've never grown these types of lily flowers, give them a try. Growing them indoors is easy and, with 
 good care, you'll enjoy their gorgeous flowers year after year. 
 You'll find these types of lilies for sale in spring and summer. You can buy lilies in nurseries and 
 some online flower delivery sites. 
 Amazon lilies are sometimes also known as Eucharist Lily and Star of Bethlehem. 
  
  
 Amazon Lily Care Tips

 Angel Trumpet Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Brugmansia x candida 
 Angel trumpet plant boasts big, trumpet-shaped flowers all summer and throughout fall. 
 Give this tropical evergreen warmth, humidity and plenty of sunlight to thrive. A sunny window, greenhouse or sunroom is ideal. You can scoot your container to your sunlit porch or patio for the summer, if you want. (Those magnificent flowers are extremely fragrant and may be overpowering indoors.) 
  
  
  
  
 This twining climber has vining stems densely covered with dark-green oval leaves. Scrolled flower buds 
 emerge in summer at the tips of stems and open up to white, pink or yellow trumpet flowers that can grow to 
 10 in (25 cm) in length. Some newer varieties have 2 colors and double blooms. 
 Train your plant. Provide a trellis to support its vigorous, climbing stems and to show off 
 those glorious pendulous flowers. Use plant ties to hold each vine in place. 
 Tie them loosely so that you don't restrict growth, and re-tie vines as they grow. 
  
 Caring for Angel Trumpet Year-Round 
  
  
 Make it bloom. 
 Put angel trumpet plant in a sunroom or by a sunny window. Moving your plant outdoors 
 for the summer will give it more blooming power. A sunny spot is ideal. Just be sure to bring it back 
 inside before the temperature drops below 50°F/10°C at night. 
 Repot in spring. 
  This is one of the few flowering plants that grows well in a large container. Move 
 it up 1 pot size every spring as necessary. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil which can lead to root rot. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
 Angel trumpet vine is tropical, not hardy so keep it at room temperature. Although it's evergreen, 
 growth will slow down over the winter. Stop fertilizing and water sparingly in winter, but never allow the soil to dry out completely. 
 Prune it back. 
  Angel trumpet plant is a vigorous climber. If you want to control its size, 
 prune it back after the flowers have faded -- by half when necessary. 
 Angel's trumpet flowers at the tips of new vines, so you'll get more 
 blooms this way. During the growing season,  
 cut off spent blooms 
 to encourage new growth and more flowers. 
 Use 
 sharp pruners to cut just above a leaf axil. 
 Check for bugs. 
  Watch for  
 spider mites 
  and treat any infestation immediately. Maintain high humidity to help deter these 
 pests that prefer dry conditions. 
 Is Angel Trumpet poisonous? 
  YES. All parts of this plant are extremely poisonous. Keep it away from children and pets, and wear 
 gloves while handling it. 
  
 Angel Trumpet Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrid with parents native to subtropical South America 
 Height: 
 Give angel's trumpet plant plenty of space. It grows up to 6 ft (1.8 m) in a container, 
 and spreads about as wide. 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. Give it  
 at least 
 4 hours of direct sunlight each day. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly spring through fall. Cut back on water in the winter, when growth has slowed. 
 Humidity: 
 This South American native likes humid air; aim to maintain 50% relative humidity or higher. Use a  
 humidity tray 
 or cool-mist room humidifier 
  to raise the moisture in the air around it. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C. This subtropical plant 
 doesn't like the cold at all. It will tolerate a minimum of 50°F/10°C in winter. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality potting mix specially made for container plants 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3-4 in (8-10 cm) stem tip cuttings in early spring and root them in moist soil. Propagating 
 the cuttings requires a  
 heat mat 
 for best results.

 Angel Wing Begonia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Begonia x corallina 
  hybrids 
 Angel wing begonia house plants are gorgeous year-round. Even when not in bloom, the elegantly shaped 
 begonia leaves cascading down cane-like stems are beautiful. Often spotted with white, the big, glossy green 
 leaves feature reddish undersides. 
  
  
  
 The sprays of delicate flowers are just an added attraction. Bloom time is different for each 
 variety, but most angel wing begonias flower in the spring. Flower colors range from soft pink to deep red. 
 Care is easy, too. This is one of the easiest begonias to grow indoors. Much less fussy about humidity than 
 rex begonias, this member of the family is less challenging to grow. 
 The begonia family owes its name to Frenchman Michel Begon. It includes more than 900 species 
 and thousands more hybrids and cultivars. 
 There are many named varieties. 
 Among the best for growing indoors are  
 'Bubbles' 
  -- a compact cultivar that blooms nearly year-round... 
 colorful  
 'Cracklin Rosie' 
  features reddish foliage spotted with rose-pink... 
 'Looking Glass' 
  has stunning 
 silvery green leaves with red undersides. 
  
 Angel Wings are beautiful, even without flowers. Put them on a pedestal stand to show them off. 
  
 Caring for Angel Wings Year-Round 
  
 Repot in spring. 
  Move your plant up to a pot only 1 size larger. Angel wing begonias have 
 fibrous roots and grow best when slightly pot-bound. Tamp down the soil gently with your fingers so that 
 it doesn't pack too tightly -- begonias like a little air around their roots. 
 Don't overwater. 
  This is probably the only common problem with growing begonias. Using a small pot with 
 a drainage hole will help to prevent overwatering. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. The 
 beautiful angel-winged leaves will let you know when the soil is too soggy by turning yellow and dropping off. 
 Also watch for yellow halos on leaves. They're a sign of  
 leaf spot 
  -- a bacteria that grows in a 
 moist, cool environment. Cut off affected leaves and be sure your plant has air circulation around it. However, 
 keep it away from heat/AC vents. 
  
  
 Angel Wing Begonia Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
  Up to 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 Give your angel begonia plenty of bright, indirect light. You'll get the best 
 leaf color and more flowers this way. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, allowing the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
  
 This (mostly) foliage-type begonia is tolerant of average room humidity. 
 However, if the air in your home is dry, use a pebble tray or  
 room humidifier 
  to give it a boost. 
 Grouping tropical plants such as begonias, ferns and orchids also helps to increase the moisture in the air around them. 
 Misting begonias is not a good idea because it can promote  
 powdery mildew 
  
 and fungal diseases. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. Begonias are not cold-tolerant 
 and can be damaged by temperatures below 50°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
 African violet potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with high-potassium liquid 
 fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Take care to fertilize when the soil is already moist to avoid fertilizer burn. 
 Propagation: 
  Stem cuttings root easily. Take 3-4 in (8-10 cm) non-flowering stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and 
 root them in moist perlite.

 Anthurium Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Anthurium andraeanum 
  
 Anthurium 
  plant is among the best-known tropical flowers. Popular in tropical flower arrangements, Anthurium bouquets 
 are often used in weddings on Hawaii and other Pacific islands. 
  
  
  
  
 Anthurium andreanum 
 , also known as tail flower, is especially colorful from spring through fall. Anthurium flowers are 
 long-lasting, and newer cultivars will bloom almost year-round. 
 The glossy red, heart-shaped flowers are actually spathes that last for several weeks, each with a white spadix 
 covered densely with its tiny, true flowers. Some varieties have spathe colors that are pink, orange-red or white. 
 Long, dark-green leathery leaves grow up to 8-in (20 cm) long, held on upright stems.  
 Anthurium leaves are poisonous 
 . They contain 
 calcium oxalate crystals that cause severe burning in the mouth. Keep the plant away from pets who may play with or chew on its foliage. 
 It's also a good idea to wear gloves when handling this plant to avoid skin irritation. 
  
 Anthurium is a Keeper 
  
 Anthurium is a perennial that will live for several years with good care. What's more, you can divide older plants for an ongoing collection (see "Propagation" below). 
  
  
 Caring for Anthurium Plants as Houseplants 
  
 Raise the humidity. 
  Because of the need for humidity, Anthurium growing can be challenging in the 
 home. However, newer cultivars are less fussy than the species. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a 
 humidity tray or room humidifier to increase the moisture in the air. Grouping plants also helps to maintain the humidity 
 around them. Brown leaf tips may be a sign of dry air. 
 To repot...or not. 
 The best time to repot your Anthurium plant is when new growth begins in spring. 
 Move into a pot that's only 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) bigger -- and only when necessary. Set the plant high so that the crown sits above 
 the soil line. If roots show up at the surface between repottings, cover them with potting mix. Use a pot with 
 drainage holes to prevent soggy soil; good drainage is essential. 
 Keep it clean. 
 Anthurium leaves are naturally glossy. Just wipe them with a damp cloth to keep them 
 dust-free. Avoid leaving water drops on the leaves because it may cause brown spots, a fungus that needs to be treated 
 with a fungicide. 
  
 Yellow leaves 
  are typically a symptom over-watering, but may be caused by cold drafts. This South American native wants warmth, year-round. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
   
 Spider mites 
  may invade Anthurium in the winter, if the air is dry. Watch for webbing between the leaves and stems, usually the first tell-tale sign of an invasion. Treat any infestation immediately.  
 Fungus gnats 
  are attracted to wet, peaty potting mixes; they're easier to get rid of. 
  
 Anthurium Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Columbia 
 Height: 
 Up to 18 in (45 cm); compact cultivars reach only 12 in (30 cm). Tall flower stems may need staking. 
 Light: 
  
 Bright light will make these beauties bloom. Give your plant as much bright 
 light as you can year-round (at least 4 hours of bright light each day), but keep it out of direct sun. A curtain-filtered sunny window is ideal. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall, slightly drier in winter. 
 Yellow leaves are often caused by overwatering. 
 Water thoroughly, but don't allow soil to get soggy. 
 Humidity: 
 This South American rain forest native craves high humidity year-round. Try to maintain 50% relative humidity or higher. Here are some easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 (65-80°F/18-27°C) Anthurium plant prefers steady warm temps, just like we do. Protect it from cold blasts from doorways, windows and A/C vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix with added perlite for good drainage; African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer 
 . 
 Propagation: 
 Divide crowded clumps when repotting. When a plant grows a new crown near the main plant, gently pull it away and plant it separately in a small container, keeping the crown of the plant above the soil line. New plants should 
 bloom in about a year.

 Florist's Azalea Care Tips 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Rhododendron simsii 
 Good azalea care will help your flowers to stay beautiful. You'll find azaleas for sale in florist's shops any time of year, but those exquisite blooms are especially popular in the winter when gardens are out of bloom. 
  
  
  
  
 If your potted azalea just came from the florist or garden center, it likely has a plastic or foil covering over the plastic pot. Remove any wrapping right away so that the drainage holes aren't blocked.  
 Nurseries grow azaleas in small pots to restrict their roots (they bloom best this way), so don't repot your plant. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, slip it into a  
 cachepot 
  (a decorative container without drainage holes). I keep pebbles at the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 This tender blooming house plant, known as florist's azalea, flowers in abundance in shades 
 of pink, white, peach, lavender, red or bi-colored. 
 Azalea flowers are about 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) across and are often 
 double or semi-double. Some azalea varieties have ruffled petals. 
 Dark-green, oval leaves cover this small, spreading shrub. Its woody stems bear clusters of flowers at their tips. 
 With bright light and cool temperatures, azalea will bloom for about 3-4 weeks. 
  
 Year-Round Azalea Care 
  
 Deadhead flowers. 
  Prune off spent flowers to encourage more blooms and keep your plant looking its best. 
 Make it re-bloom 
 . This tender florist's plant is somewhat challenging to get to rebloom and is often treated 
 as a temporary house plant and tossed out after blooming. 
 It needs about 2 months of cold -- but not freezing -- temperatures (between 40-55°F/4-13°C) in 
 fall or winter to produce buds. 
  
 Good azalea care - careful watering, bright light, deadheading - will bring on those pretty flowers. 
  
 Prune your plant 
 . Pruning azaleas will force the stems to branch out, making it a much more attractive plant. 
 Yearly pruning will promote vigorous new growth. Don't be afraid to prune large plants back hard, after flowering. 
 Azaleas produce flowers at the end of new stem tips, so you'll get more flowers this way. 
  
 Pruning azaleas tip: 
  Cut the stem at a 45° angle, 1/4-inch above a leaf node (the place where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem). Use clean, sharp pruning shears to avoid tearing the woody stems. 
  
  
 Dropped flowers? 
  Protect your azalea plant from drafts. Flower buds may shrivel and turn brown if exposed to the hot, 
 dry air of a heat vent. Add extra humidity with a room humidifier or by placing the plant on a tray of wet pebbles. I 
 wouldn't recommend misting because azalea is prone to fungus, which can kill the plant. 
 Brown leaves 
  are often a symptom of azalea diseases such as fungus or root rot. An affected plant should 
 be discarded because it will not recover. 
 Repot only when necessary 
 , every 3 years or so. Azaleas flower best when slightly pot-bound. 
 Never repot a plant when it's in bloom, which may cause its flowers to drop. Wait till after flowering and use a pot with a drainage hole. Using a clay half-pot -- also called an azalea pot -- is ideal for restricting the plant's roots and also allows good drainage. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Dry indoor air may attract  
 spider mites 
  to houseplants. You'll likely discover webbing between leaves and stems as the first tell-tale sign of these pests. Treat any infestation immediately. If not controlled early, they can destroy your plant then move on to your other indoor plants. If your azalea is badly infested, get rid of it. 
 With good azalea care, this beautiful flowering shrub will dependably produce blooms for many years. 
 Remember -- it's frost-tender. Unlike hardy azaleas that can be grown in the garden, this florist's type cannot 
 withstand freezing temperatures and should not be planted outdoors unless you live where winters are short and mild. 
  
 Azalea Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Asian hybrids 
 Height: 
  Up to 2 ft (60 cm) as a potted plant. Dwarf azaleas are more compact. 
 Light: 
  Bright light, no direct sun. 
 Water: 
  Use a pot with drainage holes and water thoroughly to wet all the roots. Empty drainage tray so that plant isn't sitting in water. If allowed to dry out, foliage shrivels and flowers wilt. This acid-loving plant shouldn't 
 be watered with hard water. Use rainwater or distilled water. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate (at least 40% relative humidity) or higher. Don't mist with water because misting can lead to fungus. It's best to use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  to raise moisture in the air around your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool to average room temperatures (60-70°F/16-21°C) 
 Soil: 
  Peat-based (lime free) potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Fertilizing azaleas during the growing season will keep them healthy and flowering. With azalea 
 care should be taken to use a fertilizer specially made for acid-loving plants. Feed every 2 weeks with a high-phosphorus fertilizer that contains iron, diluted by half. Yellow leaves with green veins 
 are a sign of a nutrient deficiency caused by too much lime. 
 Propagation: 
  Can be propagated from stem cuttings, although it is slow to root and the results rarely match the quality of the original plant.

 Flowering Banana Shrub 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Michelia figo 
 or  
 Magnolia figo 
 Banana Shrub is a sub-tropical evergreen that makes a gorgeous container plant. Its creamy yellow flowers, 
 sometimes with a blush of purple, are small and cupshaped, resembling mini magnolia blossoms. However, what makes the 
 blooms especially captivating is their sweet banana-like fragrance. 
  
  
  
  
 Buy Banana Shrub 
  
 Michelia figo 
  is also known as  
 Magnolia figo 
  because it is in the magnolia family, and may labeled by that name. 
 You may have difficulty finding this fragrant shrub in garden centers unless you live in a tropical or subtropial climate. 
 Look for it at online nurseries. 
  
 Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Give your plant plenty of sunlight and you can expect a show of fragrant flowers in early spring, with blooms  
 continuing sporadically through the summer.  
 Even before it blooms, its glossy, dark-green foliage is attractive. If you notice new leaves covered with brown fuzz, that's normal until they mature, growing to about 3-in (8 cm) long.  
 Michelia figo 
  banana shrub is evergreen and makes a beautiful indoor tree year-round. 
 Did you buy a small nursery plant? 
  It may look sparse, with few branches and leaves. Give it time. Your banana shrub will soon grow lush and full. And 
 Michelia figo 
  is eager to bloom, so you won't have to wait long for the wonderfully scented flowers. 
 Wondering when to repot? 
  Pot up only when the plant fills the container, moving to a pot that's only 1-2 inches larger. Why? Using a pot that's too big will hold too much water, which can lead to root rot. Besides, your banana shrub blooms best when its roots are slightly root-bound. 
 Brown leaf tips 
  indicate dry soil or a build up of soluble salts. Soluble salts come 
 from the chemicals in tap water and fertilizers and can damage foliage and roots. It's a good idea to flush salts 
 from the soil every year. 
  
 How to Flush Salts: 
  Slowly pour lukewarm water over the soil. Allow water to drain out the drainage holes. Pour more water through the pot, then empty the drainage tray. Flushing salts every year will keep your plant healthier and takes only minutes to do. 
  
  
 Prune it back. 
 Unlike many shrubs, this one is slow-growing, with a round, compact shape. It will grow tall unless you prune it back. Winter is the best time to prune. Cut just above a node. Cuts made here will encourage branching. Always use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems. 
  
 Banana Shrub Care 
  
 Origin: 
  China 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 to 10 ft (1.8 to 3 m); it responds well to pruning and can be easily kept around 4-5 ft (1-1.5 m) 
 Light: 
  Bright light to direct sun 
 Water: 
 Small plants should be kept lightly moist. This shrub is drought-tolerant when it is grown. For larger plants, drench and dry: water thoroughly to moisten all the roots, then allow the top 1-2 inches to dry out before watering again. 
 Use a pot with drainage holes -- s 
 oggy potting medium can lead to root rot. 
 Humidity: 
  Aim to maintain 50% relative humidity or higher. You can  
 increase humidity 
  around the plant by putting it on pebble tray. 
 The pebbles keep the pot above the water so the roots don't rot. I do this for some of my plants and it works 
 beautifully to add humidity to the air around them. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. This subtropical shrub is hardy to USDA Zone 8, 
 so if you scoot the container outdoors for the warm months, bring it back in when the temp drops in autumn. 
 Soil: 
  Slightly acidic medium that drains well, a peat moss-based potting mix such as African violet mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2-3 weeks with a high-phosphorous fertilizer, while plant is 
 growing (spring and summer). I usually use half the recommended amount of fertilizer on the container. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings (with leaves attached) in summer. Dip the cut ends in  
 rooting hormone powder 
 , then insert in sterile moist potting medium. They'll root easily  
 in about 5-6 weeks. 
  
 Take a Stand 
  
 Running out of space for your house plants?  
 Indoor plant stands 
  may be just the solution. Take a look at these new ways to display your indoor plants.

 Bat Flower 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Tacca chantrieri 
 Want a truly unusual flower? Look no further than Bat Flower. Give it some space to spread its wings. Those dark, 
 exotic flowers grow up to 12 inches (30 cm) across, and feature "whiskers," making  
 T. chantrieri 
  an intriguing houseplant and a real conversation-starter. 
  
  
  
  
 You can expect flowers when your plant gets enough sunlight, typically in late spring through summer. 
 Blooms are 
 may be black, brown or purplish, and 
 made up of 6-lobed umbels, surrounded by 2 bracts that look like wings. Long, whisker-like threads 
 reach up to 24 inches (60 cm) long. If you can give your plant the light, moisture and humidity it craves, you may see several flowers at the same time. It's quite a sight. 
 Its lush, lance-shaped leaves are broad, and can reach 2 ft long or more. This is a plant that needs plenty of room. 
 An unusual tropical flower in the Dioscoreaceae family, this ornamental belongs to a diverse group, including 
 yams. 
 Tacca chantrieri 
 is rare, but sometimes 
 available from online nurseries. 
 A white variety ( 
 Tacca integrifolia 
 ) of this plant exists, but my sources tell me that White Bat Flower is not as 
 easy to grow indoors. 
  
 Native to the rainforest in Yunnan Province, China, this tropical perennial is suited to average indoor temperatures. 
 However, it doesn't like dry air at all, which can make it difficult to please in many homes. 
 Give your plant the humidity it craves. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a pebble 
 tray or room humidifier to increase the moisture in the air. Grouping plants also helps to maintain 
 the humidity around them. 
 In early spring, repot rhizomes in fresh potting mix. Unlike many flowering plants, this one doesn't like to 
 be crowded so give it some space. This is a good time to divide rhizomes and pot them separately. 
  
 Bat Flower Care Tips 
  
 Photo credit:  
 Meneerke Bloem 
  
 Origin: 
  Tropical China 
 Height: 
  Up to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
   
 These tropical flowers need bright light to bloom, but keep them 
 out of direct sunlight. 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil lightly moist at all times. Use a pot with a drainage hole 
 to prevent soggy soil, which will cause the rhizomes to rot.  
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high, preferably 50-70% relative humidity. Use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier or pebble tray 
  to increase the moisture in the air. Do not mist this plant. 
 Temperature: 
  Steady temps of 65-70°F/18-21°C year-round. Keep your bat flower away from heat/AC vents and away from doors and windows during the winter months. 
 Soil: 
 Neutral to acidic potting mix, which is peat-moss based. I'd mix in a couple 
 handfuls of perlite to improve drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks with a 10-20-10 water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half while plant is 
 growing and flowering. Do not feed in winter. 
 Propagation: 
  Divide rhizomes in spring and plant one piece per pot. You can allow the seed pods to dry on the plant; propagate them by planting seeds in moist potting mix. Barely cover the seeds, keep potting medium warm (about 75°F/24°C), and in bright, indirect light. Be patient -- seeds may take a few months to germinate.

 Begonia Care Tips 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Begonia x hiemalis 
 If you meet begonia care needs, you can expect months of spectacular flowers. Fortunately, it's pretty easy. 
  
  
  
  
 The begonia family includes more than 1,000 species and 10,000 hybrids and cultivars. Ongoing breeding improves these beautiful flowering house plants, giving the new hybrids more blooms than ever before. 
  
 These are hybrids of  
 B. socotrana 
  and tuberous begonia varieties. Often called winter-blooming begonia, 
 ongoing breeding offers gorgeous new varieties that are available in bloom any time of year. 
 Begonias are full, bushy, and low-growing. Their thick, reddish stems grow from tuberous roots under the soil. 
 Big, soft, dark-green leaves create a beautiful backdrop for abundant clusters of delightful flowers that are 
 available in orange, white, yellow, red, and pink. 
 When buying a new plant, it's best to choose one that has good bud color and has just started to bloom. 
 You'll sometimes find these plants labeled as Elatior or Reiger hybrids, but they include many varieties. 
 Tuberous begonias will go dormant after flowering, but you can bring them back into bloom, if you want. 
 See "After-blooming begonia care" below to find out how. 
  
 Growing Begonias Year-Round 
  
 Keep the soil moist. 
  Allowing it to dry out will leave the plant susceptible to disease. But you don't want soggy soil, either. 
 Overwatering your begonia will cause leaves to wilt and turn yellow. 
 Cut off any affected leaves as soon as you notice them. They're likely to rot and attract  
 botrytis fungus 
 . 
 Cut off spent flowers. 
  Prune off dead flowers to keep your plant looking neat and to encourage more blooms. 
 Check foliage for fungus. 
  
 Begonias are prone to  
 powdery mildew 
  -- a powdery white fungus that develops on its leaves. 
 Spray an affected plant with a fungicide and keep it away from other plants to prevent it from spreading. 
  
 After-Blooming Begonia Care 
  
  
 Begonias are challenging to maintain and regrow the following season, so they are often treated as temporary house plants. 
 However, it's entirely possible to bring them back into bloom the following year.  
 After flowering, cut back on watering 
 so that the plant is barely moist, but not completely dry. Keep it away from light during this dormant period. In about 6-8 weeks, 
 the foliage will die back. Cut off all the foliage, leaving 3 in (7.5 cm) stems. When new growth appears, remove the stems from the 
 parent plant and pot them in new potting mix. You can discard the parent plant. 
  
  
 Begonia Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrids of  
 Begonia 
   
 socotrana 
  (discovered on the island of Socotra, off the coast of East Africa) 
 and tuberous hybrids (with origins from South America) 
 Height: 
 12-18 in (30-45 cm) 
 Light: 
   
 Give your begonia plenty of bright light while it's blooming, but keep it out of direct 
 sunlight which can scorch its leaves. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist, not soggy. Allow top inch of soil to dry between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
  If relative humidity drops below 40%, use a  
 room humidifier 
  or keep pot on a tray of wet pebbles to increase humidity. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool nights (55-60°F/13-16°C) and warm days (65-75°F/18-24°C) will 
 trigger flower buds. 
 Soil: 
 Peat-based soilless mix such as African violet potting mix 
 works well. Use a pot with drainage holes. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 3 weeks with a high-phosphorus fertilizer diluted by half while plant is blooming. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3-4 in (7-10 cm) stem tip cuttings at the beginning of the growing season and root in fresh potting mix.

 Bird of Paradise Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Strelitzia reginae 
  
 The Bird of Paradise plant gets its name from the exotic flowers that look like the head of a crane. 
  
  
  
  
 The flowers stand above the foliage on tall stalks that rise up from the base of the plant. Flower bracts are sharply 
 pointed and held horizontally, looking like a bird's beak. 
 Bright orange and blue flowers fan out from the spathe, forming the bird's colorful crest. 
 Bird of Paradise blooms only when mature. You can expect blooms on a plant that is more than 5 years old in spring and summer. Each 
 flower lasts about a week, but each spathe will produce several flowers that bloom in succession. 
 Keep this plant in a sunny spot year-round. One of the common reasons mature Bird of Paradise does not bloom well is insufficient light. 
 It needs full sun in the summer and as much light as possible in winter. 
 You can move your plant outdoors for the summer. Just be careful to acclimate it to the stronger 
 light gradually or it could get sunburned. Be sure to bring the plant back inside before the first frost. 
  
 How to Get Bird of Paradise Plant to Bloom: 
  
 Give it time. Strelitzia needs to be at least 5 years old. 
 Keep it crowded...it needs to be almost root-bound. 
 Let it bask in the sun. Give it some direct sunlight year-round. 
  
  
 A spectacular specimen when in bloom, but its lush, deep-green foliage is attractive on its own. The oblong, leathery leaves have 
 deeply textured veins and look like the leaves of a banana plant. Give this plant plenty of room...its leaves grow to 18 in (46 cm) long. 
  
  
 Repot new plants in spring. Move into a larger pot each year until it grows to about 3 ft (90 cm). Thereafter, top-dress each year 
 as needed. Bird of Paradise plant needs to be almost root-bound before it will bloom.

 Bird of Paradise Plant Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 Bright light with at least 4 hours of direct sun each day year-round. One main reason Bird of Paradise does not bloom is insufficient light. A south-facing window, sunroom or greenhouse is ideal to give it the light it needs. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, but allow the the soil to dry out a bit between waterings. In winter, water sparingly. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim for 40% relative humidity or higher. Here are some easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your indoor tropical plants. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures spring through fall 60-75°F/16-24°C. In winter, a cool rest 50-55°F/10-13°C is needed. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds or division. Divide a mature plant in spring, only when absolutely necessary (i.e., it's bursting out of its pot). 
 The plant may not bloom again for a few years until it is almost root-bound again.

 Bleeding Heart Vine 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Clerodendrum thomsoniae 
 Bleeding Heart Vine makes a beautiful flowering house plant. Train it on a trellis 
 or prune it back -- you can grow it any way you like. 
  
  
  
 Clusters of gorgeous blooms decorate Clerodendrum thomsoniae. 
  
 This tropical beauty is covered with attractive deeply veined, ovate leaves. 
 Its glory, however, are the eye-catching red and white flowers that bloom profusely 
 from spring through fall. Made up of snowy white calyxes, the blooms are somewhat heart-shaped. 
 Emerging from each calyx is a bright red flower with long stamens. 
  
 You'll find this beautiful vine for sale at nurseries and online in spring and summer. 
 It's usually known as Bleeding Heart Vine and sometimes as Glorybower. 
 Look for the botanical name 
 Clerodendrum thomsoniae 
 to be sure you're getting this plant. 
 As if this plant isn't showy enough, a variegated variety exists.  
 C. thomsoniae 
   
 'Variegatum' 
  
 features marbled green leaves. 
  
 Caring for Bleeding Heart Vine Year-Round 
  
 Repot in spring 
  only when it has outgrown its container. Bleeding heart blooms best when 
 it is slightly pot-bound, so move it up to a pot only 1 size larger. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy 
 soil. 
  
 Clerodendrum thomsoniae makes a stunning flowering houseplant. 
  
 Prune vines back 
 in spring, when bleeding heart vine is beginning new growth. Flowers grow near the tips of new stems, 
 so you'll get more blooms this way. You can cut the vines back by as 
 much as half, if you want, to keep the plant at a manageable size for growing indoors. 
  
 Pruning Tip 
  
 Always prune above a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached to the stem). Use sharp, clean pruning shears to avoid jagged tears and disease. 
  
  
 Raise the humidity 
  if the relative humidity near the plant drops below 50%. You can place the pot on a tray 
 of wet pebbles. Or use a cool-mist room humidifier. Raising the humidity also helps to 
 prevent  
 spider mites 
  from invading. Watch for these pests, especially in winter when indoor air tends to 
 get dry. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
  This tropical vine is an evergreen perennial, but it may 
 stop flowering in the fall and winter months and growth slows down. 
 Unlike the popular shade-loving Bleeding Heart Plant, this vining plant won't 
 overwinter in the garden, unless you live in a tropical climate. Give it warmth, humidity and bright, 
 indirect sunlight year-round. 
 Water sparingly during this rest and stop fertilizing 
 till spring when you see new growth on the plant. 
  
 Bleeding Heart Vine Care Tips 
  
 Photo credit: United States Botanic Garden 
  
 Origin: 
  Tropical West Africa 
 Height: 
 Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) if not pruned back 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light. 
 Bleeding heart is a prolific bloomer when it gets enough sunlight. 
 It blooms heavily in spring and summer. If it doesn't bloom much, move it to where it will get 
 more light from a south- or west-facing window. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall, while bleeding heart vine is growing and 
 flowering. Water sparingly in winter, but do not let it dry out completely. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim to maintain 60% humidity -- or higher -- around the plant year-round. This is easier than it seems; set the plant on a  
 pebble tray or use a cool-mist room humidifier 
 . It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge rather than guess -- air can become extremely dry indoors during the winter months. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm (65-85°F/18-29°C) year-round 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer 
 . 
 Propagation: 
  Easy to propagate from stem cuttings. Take 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root in 
 equal parts all-purpose potting mix and perlite.

 Blood Lily 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Scadoxus multiflorus 
 Blood Lily has spectacular spherical blooms made up of fiery, star-shaped florets -- each punctuated with golden-tipped stamens.  
 Out of dozens of species,  
 S. multiflorus ssp. katherinae 
  is the most popular for growing indoors.  
 It's easy to see why, isn't it? 
  
  
  
 You can see where this flowering tropical plant gets its other common name, Fireball. 
  
 Step by Step: How to Grow a Blood Lily Bulb 
  
 This South African relative of the Amaryllis also grows from bulbs. Blood Lily is warm-natured like its cousin and will begin to grow as soon as it is potted. You can start it any time of year, as long as you can provide enough sunlight for it. 
 Here are the steps: 
  
 Pot bulb in a 6- to 8-inch (15-20 cm) pot, using all-purpose houseplant potting mix. Leave the tip of the bulb above the soil line. 
 Water just enough to lightly moisten the potting medium. Once you see new growth, increase watering to keep the medium evenly moist. 
 Feed every 2 weeks (see "Fertilizer" below). 
  
 Be patient -- it takes several months from the time the bulb is planted until you see Blood Lily bloom.  
 It is so worth the wait 
 . 
  
 What to Do After Flowering is Over 
  
 After blooms are spent, stop watering and allow the flower stems and leaves to die down naturally. 
 Scadoxus multiflorus 
  is a perennial and can be grown a few times before it begins to deteriorate in quality. 
 Allow the bulb to rest at least 6 months before starting it again. Repot the bulb in fresh potting mix then follow the steps above. 
  
 Bright red florets of the Blood Lily make it an eye-catching flower to grow indoors. 
  
 Scadoxus multiflorus 
  Buying Tips 
  
 This tropical beauty has the unfortunate name Blood Lily, but is also known as Fireball Lily for its bright red, orange-red or salmon-red flowers. 
 The variety shown here has the correct botanical name of 
 Scadoxus multiflorus ssp. katherinae 
 . Formerly known as  
 Haemanthus multiflorus  
 or 
 Haemanthus katherinae 
 , 
  it is still sometimes sold under that name. 
  
  
  
 Blood Lily Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
 Tropical South Africa 
 Height: 
 12-24 in (30-60 cm). Those large flower heads can get heavy; use support stakes to hold up tall stems, if necessary. 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun during growing season. Turn pot occasionally so that all sides are exposed to light for even growth. 
 Water: 
 Keep potting mix evenly moist, but not soggy, during growing season. 
 Humidity: 
 This tropical native will tolerate average room humidity (around 40% relative humidity). Air can get extremely dry indoors and need a boost. The most efficient way to raise the humidity around your tropical plants is with a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C suit this South African native. It will tolerate a minimum of 50°F/10°C. 
 Keep your plant away from drafts from 
 heating vents and cold blasts from doors and windows. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks while Blood Lily is growing. Use high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer such as 15-30-15 NPK, at half the recommended amount. 
 Propagation: 
 Offsets may grow around the bulb. Leave them attached for 2 seasons before breaking them off and planting them in their own pots.

 Crimson Bottle Brush Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Callistemon citrinus 
 Looking for an unusual house plant? Bottle Brush Plant is sure to grab attention -- and admiration -- from all who see it. 
 It's also attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds, if you choose to put it on your porch or patio for the summer. 
  
  
  
 This Aussie native produces captivating red blooms in summer. Image credit:  
 Capri23auto 
  
 Given enough light, the Bottle Brush Plant will readily produce upright flower spikes in spring and summer. 
 It doesn't actually have petals. Each "bottle brush" flower is made up of bright-red stamens with yellow tips, clustered on 
 flower spikes up to 4 in (10 cm) long. At the top of each fuzzy spike is a tuft of leaves. 
 Each woody stem is covered top to bottom with long, narrow leaves. The dark-green leaves are pointed at the tips and 
 grow upward, giving this captivating plant a lean, elegant look. They have a fragrant, lemony scent, giving this plant another 
 common name: Lemon Bottlebrush. 
  
 Bottle Brush Flower 
  
 An Aussie native, this evergreen shrub will do best with bright sun, warm temperatures and dry air. Give it good care, and it 
 will become a fairly large shrub. However, you can keep it compact with regular pruning. Dwarf bottle 
 brush makes a good container plant. 
 Callistemon citrinus 
  
 'Little John' 
 is a dwarf bottle brush variety, reaching 
 only 3 ft (90 cm) tall. 
  
 Year-Round Care for Bottle Brush Plant 
  
  
 Let it bask in the sun. 
  It'll make an easy indoor plant, if you can provide the sunlight Bottle Brush needs to grow and bloom. Place Bottle Brush Plant directly 
 in front of a sunny window. Or move your plant outdoors for the summer, if you want. Just be sure to bring it back inside when the 
 nighttime temperature drops to 45°F/7°C. This Australian native won't tolerate the cold. 
 Prune it. 
  Immediately after flowering is over, cut the plant back by half to keep it compact. Use sharp pruners to avoid 
 tearing at the stems, which can harm the plant. 
 Give it a rest. 
 Callistemons need a winter rest. Keep the plant in a cool place (with a minimum of 45°F/7°C). 
 Cut back on watering during this time, keeping the soil only slightly moist. 
 Repot in spring. 
  Bottle Brush Plant blooms best when slightly pot 
 -bound, so move it to a slightly larger pot only every 
 couple years or when needed. When the plant reaches the size you want, you can keep it small by repotting it in the same 
 container, just to refresh the soil. 
  
 Bottle Brush Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Australia 
 Height: 
 In its native habitat,  
 Callistemon citrinus 
  is a large shrub, growing up to 16 ft (5 m). However, contained to a pot, it is easily kept to 4 ft (1.2 m) indoors. Yearly pruning will keep it compact. 
 C. citrinus 
  
 'Little John' 
 is a dwarf bottle brush variety, reaching 
 only 3 ft (90 cm) tall. 
 Light: 
  Full sun. 
 Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. 
 Give Bottle Brush Plant as much light as you can year-round. A sunroom or a sunny spot directly in front of a window is ideal. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly spring through fall and allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering 
 in the winter, while Bottle Brush plant is resting. It's drought-tolerant, so if in doubt about watering, keep it on the dry side. Yellow leaves are a symptom of overwatering and may indicate root rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). It will tolerate dry air. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C). It's hardy in USDA Zones 9-10, so it can 
 take the summer heat. Give it a cool rest in winter with a minimum temperature of 45°F/7°C. 
 Soil: 
  Well-drained soil. Use 2 parts all-purpose potting mix and 1 part horticultural sand. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring and summer with high-potassium liquid 
 fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (7 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. Can also be sown by seed in spring.

 Bougainvillea Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Bougainvillea glabra 
 You'll find bougainvillea plant climbing arbors, scrambling along stone walls, and spilling over terra cotta pots 
 in Mexico, Greece and Southern California...any place warm and sunny will make these flowering shrubs flourish. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 If you don't happen to live in a hot climate, a sunny window, greenhouse or sunroom will do. 
 Of the hundreds of bougainvillea types,  
 Bougainvillea glabra 
 is the easiest to grow indoors and has long been a popular 
 house plant. In fact, it thrives in a pot or hanging basket as long as you can meet its need for sunlight. You'll give it even more blooming power 
 if you can move your container outdoors for the summer. That's right -- 
 you'll get the most flowers if you let these tropical beauties bask on your sunlit porch or patio. 
  
  
 Big clusters of brightly colored bracts in pink, red, orange or purple cover the plant summer through fall. The 
 papery bracts surround small, creamy white flowers. 
 You can buy bougainvillea plants in the summer, when they're beginning to bloom. You have lots of beautiful bougainvillea 
 varieties to choose from. 
 Pink  
 'Alexandra' 
 is a prolific bloomer... 
 'Magnifica' 
  has vivid purple bracts... 
 'Sanderiana' 
  
 is dazzling magenta. 
 'Raspberry Ice' 
 is ravishing red...and  
 'Harrissii' 
 has variegated gray-green foliage splashed with creamy white. 
  
 Those long, arching branches are covered with thorns, so be careful when handling them. They can cause skin irritation, too. It's a good idea to wear thick gloves when pruning or repotting this plant. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Prune back lightly in fall, after flowers fade. Pruning bougainvillea regularly will keep the plant small and prevent it from becoming leggy. 
  
  
 If allowed to grow, bougainvillea vines can be trained around a hoop or over a  
 trellis 
  
 inserted in the pot. Tie it to the support with florist wire, if you need to. However, this vigorous climber doesn't need much training 
 to twine around any type of support. 
 Repot in spring, when you see new growth. Bougainvillea blooms best when slightly pot-bound, so 
 move it to a pot 1 size larger only when necessary. While repotting, take care not to expose the roots to air for a long time because they will dry out; this Brazilian beauty likes its roots to stay moist at all times. 
 Bougies seem to shrug off pests, but may be invaded by  
 aphids 
  
 (that show up on new growth) or  
 spider mites 
  
 (they prefer dry conditions). If you see any signs of pests, isolate your plant and treat any infestation immediately. 
  
 Bougainvillea Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
  
 Height: 
  Up to 15 ft (4.5 m) if not pruned back. Can be grown as a bonsai -- bougainvillea bonsai tree can be kept small with frequent pruning. 
  
 Light: 
  Full sun. Give it at least 4 hours of direct sun each day. Bougies won't bloom without enough light. 
  
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, then allow the top 2 inches (5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. Empty drainage tray to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. Overwatering will cause leaves to turn yellow and fall off. Plant bougainvillea in a pot with drainage holes. Keep slightly drier in winter. 
  
 Humidity: 
  This South American native likes high humidity during the growing season, spring through fall. Aim for 50% relative humidity around the plant. It's a good idea to use a cool-mist room humidifier. 
  
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm temperatures 60-80°F/16-27°C. Bougainvillea plants are frost-tender. Unless you live in a climate that's warm year-round, bring your plant back inside when the temperature dips below 60°F at night. It doesn't like the cold at all. 
  
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
  
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall. I highly recommend using  
 fertilizer specially made for bougainvilleas 
 . 
  
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root them in moist soil. Propagating the cuttings requires a heat mat for best results. Cuttings should root in about 2 months.

 Brazilian Plume 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Justicia carnea 
 Looking like a pink fireworks explosion, Brazilian Plume sends up a sizzling display. 
 Keep this South American beauty warm and give it plenty of sunlight to bring on the blooms.

 Caring for Brazilian Plume Year-Round 
  
 Late bloomer 
 . You can expect flowers later in the season than most houseplants, with most blooming in late summer and fall. Those vibrant rosy plumes are a welcome sight just when your outdoor flower garden is slowing down for the year. 
 Pinch and prune 
 . 
 This robust shrub grows fast. Pinch off the growing tips to keep it from getting too big. Don't toss out those stem tips, either. Propagate them for more plants. Prune long branches to keep this shrub in shape. Cutting just above a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached) will cause the stem to branch out where it was cut. You'll get a fuller, bushier plant by pruning. The best time to prune is early spring. 
 Overwintering 
 . Move your potted  
 Justicia carnea 
  to a cooler location. It will tolerate temperatures down to 60°F/16°C in winter, when plant is resting. Reduce watering, keeping the potting medium barely moist. Stop fertilizing till spring, when Brazilian Plume begins its most vigorous time of growth. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
 Spider mites 
  may attack new growth. Look for mottled, pale leaves with webbing between them. If your plant is infested, treat it right away and keep it away from your other houseplants because the tiny critters tend to move on to the rest of your indoor garden.  
 Raising the humidity 
  will help discourage spider mites that like dry air. Brazilian Plume loves to be misted. 
 To repot...or not? 
  Repot in spring, only when you see roots growing through the drainage holes. Use a heavy pot to prevent toppling; this shrub can get top-heavy after a couple years. 
  
  
 Brazilian Plume Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  Up to 4 ft (1.2m) in a container. You can keep this shrub small by regular pinching and pruning. 
 Light: 
  Needs bright light and some direct sunlight to bloom. 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil evenly moist spring through fall. Water less in winter, while growth slows down. Water thoroughly, allowing water to escape through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. Remember to always use tepid water when watering your houseplants. Cold water shocks your tender tropicals. 
 Humidity: 
  Aim for 40% relative humidity or higher. If humidity drops in winter, use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  to increase the moisture around it. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). This South American native will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C in winter. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Use a high-phosphorous fertilizer once a month, spring through fall. Do not feed in winter. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4-inch (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and insert them in moist potting mix.

 How to Grow Japanese Camellia Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Camellia japonica 
  
 You'll be successful growing Japanese camellia indoors if you keep a few things in mind. Put them in a cool location 
 where they'll get indirect sun. Keep the soil moist. Oh, one other thing...they need high humidity. This may be easy 
 to accomplish, depending on your climate. Camellias don't like the hot, dry air of heated homes 
 in the winter. 
  
  
  
 Semi-Double Pink Camellia Japonica Bloom 
  
 Japanese camellia shrubs have woody branches covered with thick, glossy dark-green leaves. In the garden, they can grow several feet high; but indoors, you can keep them a reasonable size with regular pruning. In fact, these beauties can be grown as bonsai. 
  
 Japanese Camellia Varieties 
  
 You'll find  
 Camellia japonica 
  plants in bloom in the winter or early spring. 
 Big, showy camellia flowers are available in single, 
 semi-double and double-flowered varieties. The flowers are 3-6 inch (7.5-15 cm) wide. 
 You'll typically find camellias in pink, red or white -- sometimes speckled or striped. 
 More than 2,000 hybrids are available. 
 'Alba Plena' is an early-flowering cultivar and one of the most popular with snowy white blooms. 'Elegans' 
 sports big pink flowers often flecked with white. 'Chandlers Elegance' has lovely patterns in pink and white. 'Pink Perfection' has pale-pink double blooms. 
  
 Double-Bloom Camellia Japonica 'La Peppermint' 
  
 Caring for Japanese Camellia Plant Year-Round 
  
 Coax more blooms. 
 Growing camellias outdoors for the summer will coax new flower buds to form. Keep them 
 shaded from direct sun. Camellias are tender perennials so be sure to bring them back indoors before the first frost. 
  
 Camellia Japonica 'Pink Perfection' is one of the most popular varieties. 
  
 Prune in spring. 
 Pruning camellias will keep them a manageable size indoors and encourage branching. 
 Prune the stems back hard in spring, after flowering. Buds form on the tips of new branches, so you'll get more blooms this way. 
 Cut stems at a 45° angle, just above a node 
 (the place where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem). Use sharp pruners to 
 avoid tearing the stems. 
 Repot in spring, 
 after flowering. Move up to a container 1 size larger every 2-3 years, or when needed. If your camellia plant is already 
 big, you can top-dress instead by removing the top 2-3 (5-7.5 cm) inches of soil and replace it with fresh, lime-free soil. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Camellia diseases include black spot -- a fungus that should be treated with a fungicide specially made for black spot. Giving plants good air circulation 
 helps to prevent any fungal disease. Common pests are  
 aphids 
 and 
 scale insects 
 . These are more common when growing camellias outdoors; however, it's a good idea to check your plant over and treat any infestation immediately. 
  
 How to Grow Japanese Camellia Indoors 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Japan, China, Korea 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) indoors. Prune to keep the shrub small. Camellia can be grown as a bonsai. 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light. Some cool, direct morning sunlight is fine. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist, especially when plant is budding and flowering. Soil that's too wet or too dry 
 will cause buds to drop off. After flowering, allow top of soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim to maintain 50% relative humidity or higher. Mist foliage regularly and stand camellia plant on a tray of wet pebbles. Use a cool-mist 
 room humidifier in winter, if needed. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool 45-60°F/7-16°C . 
 Make your flowers last longer by keeping the plant in a slightly cooler location. Blooms will last for weeks if kept at 
 a maximum of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
 Likes acidic medium. Use a lime-free peat moss-based mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks, beginning with the first show of flower buds till the end of flowering. 
 Use a high-phosphorus fertilizer that contains iron. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem tip cuttings in winter and root in moist potting mix.

 Campanula Flowers 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Campanula isophylla 
 Put Campanula flowers in a hanging basket or tall pot and allow its long stems studded with bell-shaped blooms to spill over the side 
 of the container. 
  
  
  
  
 This trailing form also goes by the common names Italian Bellflower and Falling Stars. Its funnel-shaped flowers open to a 5-point starry shape, and are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) across. 
 Popular varieties include snowy white 
  
 'Alba' 
  
 and 
  
 'Stella White' 
 ... and violet-blue 
 'Mayi' 
 and 
 'Stella Blue' 
 . 
 Campanula flower is easy to grow indoors. It only demands cool air, moist soil and indirect sunlight. Treat it right and 
 you can expect masses of these violet-blue flowers to bloom in mid-to-late summer right through fall. 
  
  
 Year-Round Care for Campanula Flowers 
  
 Overwinter your plant. 
  It's a perennial and will flower year after year. Cut stems back (close to the soil level of the plant) 
 in late fall or early winter, after flowering season. It doesn't need a cold season in winter. Give it the same temperature 
 and light as usual. Keep the soil on the dry side until you see new growth in spring, then resume with normal watering. 
 To repot...or not. 
  Repot campanula plants when their roots are visible at the surface of the soil. Wait till winter or 
 early spring to repot -- never while it's blooming. Use a planter only 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger than the old one. Flowering plants bloom best when their roots are a little snug in the pot. If you want to use a decorative container that doesn't have drainage holes, use it as a cachepot; just slip your plain nursery pot into the cachepot to cover it up. 
  
  
 Remove spent blooms. 
 Cut off spent flower heads using 
 scissors or pruning shears to avoid tearing the stems. By deadheading campanula flowers, you'll not only keep your plant looking its best, you'll encourage more blooms. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
 It may be 
 aphids 
 . These insects are attracted to new growth, such as young leaves and flower buds. If your plant is infested, treat it right away with an insecticide. 
 Fungus gnats 
 are another pest to watch for -- they're attracted to moist, peaty potting mixes. 
  
 Caring for Campanula Flowers 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Northern Italy 
 Height: 
  Stems trail up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect light. Some direct sun in winter is fine. 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil moist, but not soggy while plant is growing and flowering. Soggy soil will cause root rot. 
 After flowering, allow soil to become almost dry between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
 Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). High humidity can lead to  
 gray mold 
  on leaves. Cut off any affected areas and treat plant with a fungicide. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool to average 45-65°F/7-18°C. Keep your Campanula plant away from doorways and air vents. Hot or cold drafts will cause dry, shriveled leaves and may cause flower buds to drop. 
 Soil: 
  Any good-quality houseplant potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Take stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and root them in water or moist potting mix. Sow seeds in spring.

 Candy Corn Plant, a Tropical Vine 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Manettia inflata 
  
 A vigorous climber, you can train Candy Corn Plant on a trellis. 
 Its densely leaf-covered twining stems look even more lush when gathered around a support. 
  
  
  
  
 You could also plant this beautiful, tropical vine in a hanging basket 
 -- if you like -- where it will trail as long as you allow them to. Of course, you can cut them back in spring to keep the 
 plant bushy and full. 
  
 Pruning Tip: 
 Cut the stems back by half in spring, when new growth  
 begins. Be careful not to remove flower buds. Pruning will 
 promote new growth and keep it in shape. Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems. 
  
  
 The unusual, hairy, tubular flowers are reddish-orange with yellow tips. Give Candy Corn Plant the bright light it wants, and you'll enjoy a delightful show of blooms from summer through fall. The flowers are nearly an inch (2.5 cm) long and arise from the leaf axils on short stalks. 
 You can move it outdoors for the summer if you like, but be sure to 
 bring it 
 back indoors when the temperature drops in fall. 
 This is a frost-tender plant. In fact, this tropical native doesn't like cold temperatures at all. 
  
 Did you know... 
  
 Candy Corn Plant is in the Rubiaceae family. Although there is no resemblance, it shares this family tree with coffee plants and gardenias. 
  
  
 Repot in spring when you see roots growing out of the drainage holes of the pot. Move up only 1 pot size because 
 this flowering vine blooms best when slightly pot-bound. 
 Don't worry about pruning and repotting at the same time. This vigorous, vining plant can take it. 
 Manettia inflata is formerly known as  
 Manettia luteorubra 
 and is sometimes 
 sold under that name. This unusual vine is also known by a few other common names: Firecracker Vine, 
 Candy Corn Vine and Brazilian Firecracker. Some other plants share these names, look for the 
 botanical name to be sure you're getting this plant. 
  
 Candy Corn Plant Care 
  
 Photos courtesy of Michael Wolf 
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
 6 ft (1.8 m) or more, if not pruned back 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. 
 Moving your plant outdoors for the spring and summer will give it the sunshine it needs to grow and bloom. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist spring through fall. Water sparingly in winter. 
 Humidity: 
 Use a  
 room humidifier 
  if necessary, to keep relative humidity above 40%. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). If you move your plant outdoors 
 for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. It won't, however, tolerate cold temperatures (below 55°F/13°C). 
 Soil: 
 Any good potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a high-potassium fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take non-flowering stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and root in moist soil.

 Cape Primrose 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Streptocarpus x hibridus 
 Cape Primrose is a showy relative of the African violet. You can expect months of blooms if you keep the 
 soil lightly moist and give it bright, indirect light year-round. 
 Hundreds of hybrids have been developed to offer some exciting new varieties with bigger flowers, longer 
 blooming time, and more compact foliage. There are even some trailing and dwarf varieties. 
  
  
  
  
 Long, deeply veined leaves grow in a rosette. Those leaves tear easily, so handle this plant carefully. If you 
 happen to tear a leaf, don't be afraid to cut off the damaged part -- streptocarpus is very forgiving. Older leaves 
 will shrivel and turn brown, this is normal. Cut off any old, withered leaves right away. 
 Above the foliage, tall flower stems carry clusters of trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of purple, violet-blue, 
 pink, red, lavender, white and bicolors. 
 Violet-blue  
 'Constant Nymph' 
 was the first popular hybrid introduced decades ago. Since then, hundreds of 
 named hybrids have become available.  
 'John Innes' 
  is also popular for growing indoors, and may be pink, pale violet 
 or purple. 
 Charming  
 'Falling Stars' 
 is a semi-trailing variety covered with small, violet flowers. 
 The flowers are velvety, often with contrasting veins or throat color. Flower size also depends on the variety, 
 they may be 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) across. 
  
 Shed some light. 
 Cape Primrose is sensitive to day length and won't bloom if it doesn't get enough light. 
 Find a place near a bright window for your plant, where it will get several hours of curtain-filtered sunlight. 
 This plant really thrives under 
 fluorescent lights 
 , too. 
 Use 1 warm white tube and 1 cool white tube under a reflector. Place flowers about 8 inches (20 cm) beneath the light 
 for 15 hours a day. 
 Pinch off spent blooms. 
 Flowers are sometimes followed by long, twisted seed pods. Remove dead flowers 
 as soon as you notice them to encourage more blooms instead of using its energy to develop seeds. Cut flower 
 stems back after the last bloom has faded. 
  
 Potting Tip 
  
 Don't set the plant too deeply in the pot. Keep the plant at the same level it was before because the stems and leaves may rot if they are too deep. 
  
  
 Repot Cape Primrose every 6 months. 
  You'll have a much healthier plant by repotting in spring and again in fall 
 because the fast-growing tuberous roots quickly fill the pot. Streptocarpus is also sensitive to the build-up 
 of salts from fertilizer and likes its "feet" in fresh, loose soil. 
  
 What size pot? 
  This plant blooms best when slightly pot 
 -bound, so go up a pot size 
 only when needed. Use the root ball as a guide. A good rule of thumb is to choose a pot 
 that allows only 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) space all around the root ball for a small plant and 1-inch (2.5 cm) for a larger 
 plant. An azalea pot (also known as a half-pot) works well for streptocarpus to keep its roots snug. 
 Make sure it has drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
  
  
 How to Repot: 
  Remove the plant from its pot. Gently tease as much old potting mix from the plant as possible. 
 You'll probably pull off a few of the soft, fleshy roots while doing this.  
 Don't worry 
  -- streptocarpus is a 
 vigorous grower and will soon fill its pot with new roots. Are the roots packed tightly? Tease them apart with 
 your fingers to open them up and help the roots grow into the new mix. 
 Treat your Cape Primrose well and you'll enjoy this blooming plant for many years. They're easy 
 to propagate, too. Believe me, once you grow these beauties, you can't have just one. 
  
 Cape Primrose Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  Up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light or  
 fluorescent light 
 . 
 Keep out of direct sun which can scorch leaves. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly to wet all the roots, then allow the soil to dry out a bit before watering again. 
 Soggy soil may cause root rot -- you'll notice the symptoms as leaves that look limp or turn brown around the edges. 
 Cut back on watering in winter when growth is slowed, but do not allow soil to dry out completely. Avoid getting the leaves wet, which causes spots and they won't come off. 
 Humidity: 
  Around 50% relative humidity or higher. Indoor air can get extremely dry in winter, so it's a good idea to use a  
 humidity gauge 
  rather than try to guess. Use a cool-mist room humidifier or place pot on a tray of wet pebbles. Keep 
 plant away from heat/AC vents and cold blasts from doors and windows. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool to average room temperatures 60-70°F/16-21°C. Too-hot temperatures can cause 
 the plant to wilt. 
 Soil: 
 African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with high-phosphorus liquid 
 fertilizer diluted by half. African violet fertilizer is ideal. 
 Take care to fertilize when the soil is already moist to avoid fertilizer burn. 
 Propagation: 
  Cape primroses are among the easiest of flowering plants to propagate. Here are 3 ways to do it: 
  
 Take  
 leaf cuttings 
 in spring or early summer -- the VioletBarn.com is an excellent site that shows you how step by step. 
 Divide plants 
  that have more than one crown (rosette) and pot them separately. (See repotting tips above.) 
 Sow cape primrose seeds in spring. 
 The seeds are tiny. The best way to handle them is to sprinkle the seeds from the seed packet over the already moistened seed starting medium, and do not cover seeds. Use a  
 heat mat 
  to maintain a constant 70°/21°C. Cover with clear plastic to maintain high humidity. Mist the medium lightly with  room-temperature water every day (if necessary) to keep it moist, but not soggy. You should see those first seedlings poking up in about  10-14 days. Thin out smaller seedlings to give others room to grow. Remove the plastic and give your plants bright light. You can expect those gorgeous flowers about 6 months after sowing.

 Celosia Plumosa 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Celosia argentea 
  var. plumosa 
 Celosia plumosa is finally getting some of the recognition it deserves. You'll enjoy its big, bright blooms 
 that last from spring through fall. 
 This compact plant is a tender perennial, typically grown as an annual in cold-winter regions. 
 It's not likely to bloom again, so you can toss it out when it's finished blooming in fall. 
  
  
  
  
 You have lots of colors to choose from -- vivid shades of red, yellow, orange and pink are the most common. 
 Many celosia varieties are available, including dwarf hybrids. You'll often find them for sale as  
 Celosia Plumosa 
 . 
  
 'Fresh Look' 
 red celosia is a popular cultivar with big, feathery plumes. 
 Celosia flowers are in the Amaranthaceae family and are basically of two groups. The variety shown here is the  
 plumosa 
 group. It's the more popular of the two, often grown in flower beds, containers, and indoors as house plants. 
 The second group is  
 cristata 
 , also known as cockscomb for its wavy crest of flowerheads. 
  
 Bright flowers make celosia a joy to grow. Image by  
 JacLou DL 
  
 Soft, deeply veined leaves cover the fleshy stems that hold the feathery blooms upright, above the foliage. 
 The vibrant plumes of colors are eye-catching and look spectacular when grouped together in containers. 
 It is low-maintenance and easy to grow from seed. Some seeds are sold as "mixed" so you can enjoy a variety. They're also easy to find in garden centers in spring and summer. 
 Find a spot for celosia in a sunny window or scoot the container outdoors for show-stopping color on your porch or patio. These 
 striking celosia flowers thrive in hot, sunny conditions. 
  
 Celosia Plumosa Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrids with parents from Asia 
 Height: 
 6 inches to 2 ft (15-60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun. You can grow this sun-lover on a windowsill or in a sunroom. 
 Don't have a sunny spot indoors? Moving your celosia plant outdoors for the spring and summer will give it the sunlight it needs to bloom. 
 Water: 
 Water regularly and thoroughly to maintain evenly moist potting medium. It doesn't like to dry out, but it doesn't like soggy soil either. 
 Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent root rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Higher humidity levels suit this plant, if you choose to move it outdoors for the warm months. 
 Temperature: 
 Warm room temperatures 70-80°F/21-27°C. If you move your plant outdoors 
 for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. 
 But it's frost tender. In fact, it doesn't do well in cool temperatures, so be sure to bring it 
 back indoors when the temperature drops in fall. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly with a high-phosphorous water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Easy to grow from seeds. Sow celosia seeds in spring or start seeds indoors. Seeds need to be above 70°F/21°C to germinate.

 Cigar Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Cuphea ignea 
  
 Cigar plant features tubular, orange-red flowers rimmed with white and purple, giving the flowers the look 
 of a burning cigar with ashes at the tip.

 The flowers appear in abundance from early summer to late fall. They're about 
 1 in (2.5 cm) long, growing singly from the axils of the leaves. 
 This evergreen sub-shrub is fast-growing, reaching its mature height in a year. Narrow leaves are 2 in (5 cm) 
 long and densely cover the woody stems. Prune it quite a bit to keep it small and bushy. 
  
 Repot in spring 
  when this shrubby plant gets crowded. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent overwatering -- 
 it will rot at the base if the soil gets too soggy. 
 Dry, crunchy leaves that fall off 
 is often caused by cold drafts or dry air. 
 Prune it back. 
  Cut the stems back by half in late winter to encourage new growth and more flower buds. Make the cut just above a  
 node 
  -- the place where a leaf is attached to a stem. Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems. 
 This flowering shrub is easy to grow. Just give it lots of sunlight and you'll enjoy plenty of flowers. Unfortunately, 
 this vigorous grower will become straggly over time. Plan on replacing  
 Cuphea ignea 
  after a couple years or so. 
 Cuphea ignea 
  goes by a few common names and resembles other plants. Look 
 for the botanical name to be sure you're getting this plant. 
 Some other common names include Cigar Flower and Mexican Cigar Plant. 
  
 How to Grow Cigar Plant 
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico 
 Height: 
 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. Moving your cigar plant outdoors for the spring and summer will give it the sunlight it needs. 
 Bright light will make the leaves appear brighter and the leaf tips turn an attractive reddish-purple. 
 Water: 
 Spring through fall, water thoroughly. Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings, but don't allow 
 it to dry out completely. Keep the soil slightly drier in winter. 
 Humidity: 
 Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
 Average room 65-75°F/18-24°C. If you move your plant outdoors 
 for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. It won't, however, tolerate temperatures below 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
 All-purpose, good-quality potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in summer and root them in moist perlite. Once rooted, 
 transplant them in separate pots with fresh potting mix. Sow seeds in early spring.

 Grow Cineraria Flower Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: Senecio x hybridus 
 Think of cineraria flower as a living bouquet. 
 You'll find these beautiful bloomers in floral shops in midwinter to early spring. 
 When you're selecting a new cineraria plant, look for one with plenty of unopened flower buds. Yeah, I know they're not as attractive as the fully open flowers; however, you'll enjoy your cineraria plant longer, watching all its flowers bloom. 
  
  
 Choose the color you like. Those daisy-like flowers are available in a range of vibrant colors, including pink, blue, violet blue, purple or red -- often with an inner white ring around the central eye. 
 Keep your plant in a cool location and well-watered, and you'll enjoy its profusion of flowers for about a month or two. 
 Although short-lived, cinerarias are sure to brighten up your home in winter. What could be a better pick-me-up when your outdoor flowerbed is blanketed with snow? Put your plant near a cool east- or north-facing window. Better yet, display three pots together in a windowbox-type planter. 
  
  
  
 Caring for Cineraria Flower Indoors 
  
 Wondering whether to repot? 
  You won't need to because cineraria is a temporary house plant. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, slip it into a cachepot. This type of decorative pot doesn't have drainage holes, so it's a good idea to put pebbles in the bottom to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Wilted plants 
  are often caused by dry soil. Flowering plants are thirsty, and this is one will collapse if it dries out. Check the soil often and aim to keep it lightly moist at all times. Water thoroughly to wet all the roots, allowing water to drain out the drainage holes. Don't overwater, though. Soggy soil will lead to root rot, which also causes wilting. If your plant gets root rot, just toss it out...it won't recover. 
 Flowers that wither 
  soon after opening are likely caused by hot, dry air. Ideally, keep your cineraria cool -- around 50°F/10°C. Your flowers will last longer with cool temps. In fact, you can move your plant to an enclosed porch or a sunroom for the night, if you want. Don't worry if the temperature drops to 40°F/4°C at night; cinerarias love the cool, moist air. 
 Deadhead spent blooms. 
  Use scissors to remove flowers as they fade. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  It's likely  
 aphids 
 . These tiny insects tend to hang out on stems and flower buds. It's a good idea to look over your plant each time you water. If it is infested,  
 get rid of it 
 . You don't want these pesky critters to spread to your other indoor plants.

 Cineraria Flowering Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrid cultivars developed from Canary Island species 
 Height: 
  1-2 ft (30-60 cm). 'Nana' and 'Jester' varieties are more compact, reaching about 10-inches (25 cm) tall. 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect sunlight; some cool morning sun is fine. Leaves will become pale if they are in direct sunlight, especially in too-hot temperatures. 
 Water: 
  Keep the potting medium lightly moist at all times. Cineraria will quickly wilt when allowed to dry out. Overwatering will cause root rot, which will also make it wilt. If your plant collapses even if you've been watering regularly, it likely has root rot and should be discarded. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high (at least 40% 
 relative humidity). Set pot on a humidity tray or use a cool-mist room humidifier to  
 raise the humidity 
  around the plant. 
 Temperature: 
  Keep your plant in a cool location (50-65°F/10-18°C) to prolong flowering. Cineraria flowers will tolerate a low of 40°F/4°C at night. 
 Soil: 
  Peat-moss based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Not needed 
 Propagation: 
  Sow cineraria seeds in summer to produce flowering plants the following winter. Keep seeds and seedlings at room temperature and moist, in indirect light. It takes about 4 months to bloom.

 Ardisia Crenata 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Ardisia crenata 
  
 Like Cinderella dressed for the ball, this evergreen shrub is transformed at Christmastime into a ravishing beauty, spectacularly adorned with red berries. 
  
  
  
 Bright berries adorn this shrub in winter, making Ardisia crenata a delightful houseplant. 
  
 About Your Houseplant 
  
 This compact, upright shrub can grow to 6 ft in its native tropical habitat, but indoors you can expect it to reach 
 about half that height. Slow-growing, it'll take a while to get there. 
 Glossy, deep-green leaves grow to 4 in (10 cm) long and about half as wide. Their serrated edges add to the 
 allure of this ornamental plant. 
 Clusters of petite, white or pale pink flowers grow from the leaf axils on the plant's lower branches in summer. Those lightly fragrant 
 blooms are followed by 1/4-in (6 mm) round berries. 
 Red berries are the real attraction of  
 Ardisia crenata 
 and arrive around Christmas time. You'll enjoy 
 the berries on this shrub until it starts flowering again. 
  
 Ardisia Crenata Plant Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Got a reluctant bloomer? 
  Give your plant more humidity and sunlight in spring, when it's starting to 
 form buds. Regular misting with room-temperature water will help increase the moisture in the air around it. 
 Misting also helps to keep away spider mites that prefer dry conditions. 
 Dropping flower buds 
 are likely caused by dry soil or cold air.  
 Ardisia crenata 
  likes it cool, but not too cold. 
 It will tolerate a minimum winter temperature of 45°F/7°C. Keep the plant out of entryways and away from A/C and heat vents. 
 Wondering when to prune? 
 Prune each spring before flowering, if needed, to shape up this shrub and to keep it compact. 
 Is it time to repot? 
  When the roots have filled the pot, move up to a pot 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger. Use a pot with drainage holes because it will not tolerate soggy soil. Wait till late winter or early spring to repot 
 -- never while it's blooming. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
   
 Spider mites 
  are attracted to warm, dry homes in the winter. Watch for these sap-sucking pests on your houseplants. You'll first notice their fine webbing between leaves and stems, as well as dry-looking, mottled foliage.  
 Mealybugs 
  look like white, fuzzy specks along the stems and the undersides of leaves. Treat any infestation immediately to prevent them from destroying your houseplants. 
  
 Ardisia Crenata Buying Tip 
  
 This decorative shrub isn't easy to find. Few greenhouses stock  
 A. crenata 
  plant because it is considered invasive in warm climates. However, confined to a pot, it makes a fine indoor plant. 
 A few other shrubs may go by the same common names, Christmas berry, Coral ardisia, Coralberry or Spiceberry. 
 Look for the scientific name 
 Ardisia crenata 
 to be sure you're getting this plant. 
  
  
 Ardisia Crenata Growing Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  East Asia 
 Height: 
 Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) in its native habitat; however, growing in a container indoors, it will slowly reach 3 ft (90 cm). 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light year-round. Some direct morning sunlight is fine, but keep shaded from hot, direct midday sun. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist year-round, but not soggy which can lead to root rot. Never allow it to dry out, either. It's a good idea to use a moisture meter rather than guess when to water. Also, always use room-temperature water on your tropical houseplants because cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
  
 These tropical shrubs do best with moderate-to-high ( 
 about 50-60%) relative humidity. Homes can become extremely dry in winter; use a cool-mist room humidifier 
 , if necessary. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average room temperatures 45-65°F/7-18°C. Keep  
 Ardisia crenata 
  out of cold drafts from doorways and away from A/C and heat vents. 
 Soil: 
 Soil-based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks from early spring through summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10) water-soluble fertilizer. 
 In fall and winter, feed monthly. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow seeds in spring, and be patient -- seeds can take several weeks to germinate. Use sterile seed-starting mix, keep moist, and maintain 70°F/21°C at all times; it's a good idea to use a  
 seedling heat mat 
  to ensure even temperature. Or take 4-6 in (10-15 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and place 
 upright in moist peat moss-based potting mix. Cover the plant and pot in a plastic bag to hold in humidity. 
 Propagating this plant is hit-or-miss. Neither method is easy.

 Growing Crocus Bulb Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Crocus 
  bulb hybrids 
 Crocus flowers are among the first to herald spring, sometimes popping their bright blooms through the snow. Fortunately, we 
 don't have to wait till spring to enjoy these glorious flowers. Growing crocus indoors is easy to do by forcing them 
 into bloom mid-winter. Start the process in fall -- October is an ideal time. 
 A crocus bulb is actually a  
 corm 
 . Corms produce beautiful cup-shaped blooms in purple, lavender, white or yellow -- plain or striped -- 
 each with a bright orange stigma. All have slender, upright leaves that are green and white striped.

 Buying Crocus Bulbs 
  
  
 Choose good-sized corms that are firm -- not soft or mushy. Don't buy any that are sprouting. After waiting for months for these beauties to bloom, you 
 don't want to be disappointed. 
 You'll find top-quality crocus corms at online nurseries in fall. 
 Many varieties are available to choose from 
 . Dutch crocus bulb hybrids are favored for their large blooms. Among the best for growing 
 indoors... 'Pickwick' has silvery lavender petals with dark purple stripes... 'Remembrance' giant blooms are shiny, deep purple... 
 and 'Flower Record' giant crocus is available in several colors. 
 Because each variety tends to bloom at a different time, it's best not to mix them. You'll enjoy a mass of beautiful blooms by planting one crocus bulb variety per pot. 
  
 How to Force Crocus Bulbs - Step by Step 
  
 Crocuses need a cold treatment for 12 weeks to bloom. 
 If you bought pre-chilled corms, you can skip this step. 
 Choose a shallow pot (at least 3 in/7 cm deep) with drainage holes in the bottom. Fill the pot loosely with potting mix. Set several corms side by side -- close but not touching -- pointed end up. Set corms so that their tips are even with pot rim. Do not press the corms into the mix. It should be loose so the roots can grow through it easily. Cover with additional potting mix until just barely covered. 
 Water thoroughly and discard drainage. 
 Move pot to a dark, cool, but not freezing, (40°F/4°C) location such as a basement, unheated garage or refrigerator. Avoid storing corms near ripening fruit or vegetables which give off ethylene gas which can damage the corms. Keep them in cold storage for about 12 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist. 
 When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, bring the pot out of cold storage and place it in a slightly warmer (50°F/10°C) location with low light intensity. Over the next few days, gradually move it toward a sunny window. Turn the pot every day for even growth. When in full bloom, keep crocuses in a bright location out of direct sun to prolong the bloom. 
  
 Imagine bright yellow crocus flowers blooming in a sunny window mid-winter. 
  
 Crocus Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrids with corms originating from Europe, North Africa and Asia 
 Height: 
 Up to 8 in (20 cm) 
 Light: 
 Keep in a dark location during cold treatment. Cover pot with a box, pot or black garbage bag if necessary. 
 After shoots appear, move to bright light with some direct sun as directed above. 
 Water: 
 Water sparingly until growth appears, then water enough to keep soil evenly moist. Flowering plants 
 are thirsty, so check them often. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average (40-60°F/6-16°C). 
 Make your flowers last longer by keeping the plant in a slightly cooler location. Blooms will last for weeks if kept at 
 a maximum of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
 Any good-quality potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half from planting until start of blooming. 
 Do not fertilize while plants are in bloom. 
 Propagation: 
 Corms will not bloom a second time indoors. They do produce offsets, but they take a few 
 years to mature. If you want to keep them, allow the foliage to die back naturally, then store them in a cool, dry place. Plant the corms in 
 your flower garden in the fall and let Mother Nature take care 
 of them. They'll bloom when they're ready.

 Florist Cyclamen Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Cyclamen persicum 
  
 Thanks to new hybrids, cyclamen plants are bigger, more vigorous and showier than ever before. Rising above heart-shaped, silver-and-green leaves are upright stems bearing beautiful backswept petals in shades of pink, purple, red 
 or white. 
  
  
  
  
 Keeping Your Cyclamen Plant 
  
  
 Winter-blooming cyclamen plant is usually bought in flower from the florist and treated as an annual, then unfortunately, is tossed out 
 when it begins to deteriorate in spring. However, cyclamen plant is a perennial that you can enjoy for years. 
 With good care, this cool-season, flowering house plant will last for several months, then can be brought back to bloom the next winter. 
 When flowers die and foliage turns yellow, cut it back. Put the dormant plant in a cool, dark spot for the summer giving it just enough water 
 to prevent its roots from drying out completely. In fall, put the plant back in bright light and resume watering and fertilizing. Blooms 
 should appear in 2-3 months. 
  
 Cyclamen Problems and Cures 
  
 Sudden wilting of leaves and flower stems is caused by dry soil. Don't worry -- they'll usually come right back after a thorough watering. 
 Stems and flowers that don't respond can be pinched off. 
 Wet soil and poor ventilation may cause 
 botrytis 
 -- a gray, fuzzy fungus that can quickly kill the plant. Yellowing leaves with brown patches 
 are a sign of botrytis. Cut off the affected leaves. If the plant is badly affected, 
 get rid of it 
 . Cutting off spent flowers and 
 any yellow or shriveled leaves will help air circulation around the plant and help prevent the fungus from growing. 
 Aphids 
  and  
 spider mites 
  may attack cyclamen. Look over your plant every time you water. Aphids tend to hang out on stems and new growth. You'll notice the presence of mites by the webbing between stems and leaves. Treat any infestation immediately. 
  
 Buying Tips 
  
  
 There are hundreds of cyclamen hybrids to choose from. Many are not even named, making it difficult to recommend one. 
 Some petals are striped, frilly or tipped with a contrasting color. A few varieties are sweetly scented. Miniature cyclamens 
 are charming, reaching only 5 in (13 cm) tall. 
 Vibrant blooms make them must-have house plants. Even their lacy leaves are beautiful. Set one on a  
 plant stand 
  to show it off. 
  
 Cyclamen Plant Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrids with parents from Southern Europe and the Middle East 
 Height: 
  6-12 in (15-30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light. Some direct winter sun is okay. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist. It's best to water plant from below by placing pot in a saucer of tepid 
 water for no more than 20 minutes. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate (around 40-50% relative humidity).  
 Increase humidity 
  with a room humidifier or a humidity tray. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool temperatures 55-70°F/13-21°C year-round. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks with high-phosphorus fertilizer diluted by half  
 only 
 while plant is budding and blooming. 
 Propagation: 
  Cyclamen seeds are tiny, and slow to germinate. Sow seeds in late summer through fall. They must be kept at 70°F/21°C to germinate; use a  
 heating mat 
  to maintain warmth. You'll wait about a year and a half for most varieties to bloom.

 Growing Daffodils Indoors: Steps to Forcing Bulbs 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Narcissus 
  spp. 
 Growing daffodils indoors will bring a bright bouquet of spring-fresh flowers 
 to your home in the middle of winter. 
 Naturally spring-bloomers, daffodils are easy to force into bloom early. Making a plant bloom at a 
 time other than its natural bloom time is called "forcing."  
 Start forcing daffodils sometime in 
 October or November for mid-winter to early-spring flowers 
 . 
  
  
  
 Gorgeous daffodils brighten up a sunny window long before spring arrives. 
  
 You have beautiful daffodil varieties to choose from -- in shades of yellow, cream, orange, pink or white. 
 The trumpet, also called a cup, may be a color contrasting to the ring of petals. Sizes vary quite a bit, 
 from pint-sized minis to tall plants with giant flowers. 
  
 As if daffodils aren't showy enough, some of them flaunt double petals, frilly trumpets -- even 2 colors 
 per bloom. 
 Choose bulbs for forcing 
 . Some common varieties that are good for forcing are listed below. 
 Some large flower heads get pretty heavy and will need to be staked. 
 Miniature varieties are ideal for growing indoors. Don't dismiss miniature daffodils -- they're charming planted 
 close together in a pot. 
  
 What to Know About Buying Daffodils 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 Because daffodil varieties tend to bloom at different times, it's best not to mix them. They tend to look best, anyway, in a mass planting of 1 variety per pot. 
  
  
 It's a good idea to order daffodil bulbs early to ensure their availability. 
 Try to have them shipped no earlier than mid-September. 
 Buy the best-quality daffodil bulbs you can find from a reputable company. Bulbs should be firm, 
 without soft spots or scars. Bulbs with 2 "noses", or tips, will produce 2 stems. 
 For sure success, buy varieties that are labeled "good for forcing." You'll find this noted in bulb catalogs. 
  
 Mini daffs are charming planted in a pot. Don't be afraid to crowd them for the best display. 
  
 Daffodil Varieties 
  
 There are several cultivars available that are especially dependable for forcing 
 . 
 Daffodils with bright yellow blooms include  
 'Dutch Master' 
  ... 
 'Soleil d'Or' 
 ... 
 and  
 'Unsurpassable' 
 . 
 Bi-color daffodils include  
 'Barrett Browning' 
 , a long-time favorite with snowy white petals and an orange-red trumpet. 
 'Fortune' 
 has soft-yellow petals with a trumpet edged in dark orange.  
 'Ice Follies' 
 is white with a creamy yellow trumpet. 
 Miniature daffodils only reach about 6 in (15 cm) tall and include 
  'Little Gem' 
 ,  
 'February Gold' 
 and  
 'Tete-a-Tete' 
 . 
 Double-bloom varieties include buttery-yellow  
 'Bridal Crown' 
  and pink-and-white  
 'Repleat' 
 . 
 The only difficult thing about growing daffodils may be choosing a variety. 
  
 Steps for Forcing Daffodils 
  
  
 Choose a wide pot about 6 in (15 cm) deep with drainage holes in the bottom. Fill the pot loosely with potting mix. Set bulbs side by side -- close but not touching -- pointed end up, so that their tips are even with the pot rim. Do not press the bulbs into the mix. It should be loose to allow the roots to grow through it easily. Cover with additional potting mix, just so their noses are barely covered. 
 Water thoroughly and empty drainage tray. 
 Daffodils need a cold treatment for 8-10 weeks 
 . If you bought pre-chilled bulbs, you can skip this step. Move pot to a dark, cool, but not freezing (40-45°F/4-7°C) location such as a basement, unheated garage or refrigerator. Avoid storing bulbs near ripening fruit or vegetables because they give off ethylene gas which can damage the bulbs. Keep them in cold storage for about 8-10 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist. 
 When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, bring the pot out of cold storage and place the growing daffodils in a slightly warmer (50°F/10°C) location with low light. Over the next few days,  
 gradually 
 move it toward a sunny window. (By moving it in small steps while it's growing, daffodils will last longer.) Turn the pot every day for even growth. 
 When in full bloom, keep potted daffodils in a bright location out of direct sun. Make your daffodils last longer by 
 keeping the pot in a cool room. Flowers will last about a month if kept at a maximum of 60°F/16°C. 
  
 Growing Daffodils - Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Europe 
 Height: 
 Up to 18 in (46 cm); miniature varieties reach 6 in (15 cm). 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect light. Rotate the pot once in a while because 
 growing daffodils will tend to lean toward the light source. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil lightly moist. Growing daffodils are thirsty, so it's a good idea to check the soil often. 
 Humidity: 
 Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
 After the cold treatment (see "steps to forcing" above) keep cool 60°F/16°C while plants are in bloom. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Daffodil bulbs cannot be forced a second time indoors. You can transplant the bulbs 
 outdoors, but it may take 2-3 years before they'll bloom again. If you want to keep them, allow the 
 foliage to die back naturally, storing daffodil bulbs in a cool, dry place. Then plant the bulbs 
 in your garden in the fall.

 Dragon Wing Begonia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Begonia x hybrida 
 Dragon wing begonia house plants are beautiful and easy-to-grow year-round. 
 You can expect sprays of 
 white, pink or red flowers in late spring and summer. Even when not in bloom, the 
 big, glossy wing-shaped begonia leaves are delightful. 
  
  
  
  
 Dragon wing begonias are vigorous growers, reaching up to 2 ft (60 cm) tall -- and will spread about as wide. 
 They make dependable patio container plants. Just be sure to bring your plant indoors when the temperature drops 
 in autumn. This tropical beauty likes warm temperatures just like we do. 
 This is one of the best begonias to grow indoors. Much less fussy about humidity than 
 rex begonias, this member of the family is downright easy to grow. 
  
 Caring for Dragon Wing Begonia Year-Round 
  
 Repot in spring. 
  Move your plant up to a pot only 1 size larger. Dragon wing begonias have 
 fibrous roots and grow best when slightly pot-bound. Tamp down the soil gently with your fingers so that 
 it doesn't pack too tightly -- begonias like a little air around their roots. 
 Let the sun shine in. 
  Put your plant in a sunroom or by a sunny window. Moving your dragon wing plant outdoors 
 for the summer will give it more blooming power. A semi-sunny spot outdoors is ideal. Just be sure to bring it back 
 inside before the temperature drops to 55°F/13°C at night. 
 Don't overwater. 
  This is one of the few problems with growing begonias. Using a pot with 
 drainage holes will help to prevent overwatering. The beautiful dragon-winged leaves will let you know 
 when the soil is too soggy by turning yellow and dropping off. 
 Watch for  
 powdery mildew 
  on leaves 
 and stems. Poor air circulation and high humidity are favorable conditions for this dusty, white fungus. 
 Cut off affected leaves and be sure your plant has air circulation around it. However, 
 keep it away from heat/AC vents, which can be drying. Treat foliage with a fungicide when needed. 
  
 Dragon Wing Begonia Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
 Up to 2 ft (60 cm); It spreads out a bit too, so give it plenty of room to spread its wings. 
 Light: 
  Give dragon wings a sunny spot year-round. You'll get more flowers this way. If you move your plant 
 outdoors for the summer, keep it shaded from hot, direct midday sun. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist, but not soggy. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate (50-60% relative humidity).  
 Keep plant away from drafts. 
 This dragon begonia is tolerant of average room humidity. 
 However, if the air in your home gets dry in the winter, use a  
 pebble tray or room humidifier 
 . 
 Grouping tropical plants such as begonias, ferns and orchids also helps to increase the moisture in the air around them. 
 Misting begonias is not a good idea because it can promote powdery mildew 
 and fungal diseases. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). If you move your plant outdoors, 
 don't worry -- it can take the heat, tolerating temperatures as high as 100°F. However, when temps soar 
 that high, it's a good idea to keep it partially shaded from midday sun. Dragon wing begonia will tolerate a minimum of 
 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
 African violet potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with balanced water-soluble 
 fertilizer diluted by half. 
 In fall and winter, feed monthly. Take care to fertilize when the soil is already moist to avoid fertilizer burn. 
 Propagation: 
 Stem cuttings root easily. Take 3-4 in (8-10 cm) non-flowering stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and 
 root them in moist, sterile potting mix. Sow seeds indoors in mid-to-late winter for summer flowers. Use a  
 heat mat 
  
 and raise the humidity for best results.

 Forcing Dutch Iris Bulbs 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Iridaceae x hollandica 
 Dutch iris bulbs demand two things to grow and bloom well: sunshine and good drainage. If you have a sunny window, 
 you can easily grow these magnificent flowers in your home.

 Unlike the most irises, Dutch irises grow from bulbs, not rhizomes, making them an excellent choice for forcing. 
 Tall, upright stems and silky, delicate blooms lend elegant beauty wherever you display them. The flowers can grow 
 up to 4 inches (10 cm) across are available in a rich rainbow of colors -- blue, violet, white, yellow and bicolors. 
 Many Dutch iris varieties are available to choose from... 
 'Professor Blaauw' 
 pale blue petals with a bright yellow stripe... 
 'Blue Pearl' 
 blooms are deep violet-blue... 
 'Discovery' 
 is one of the most popular in brilliant blue with a golden-yellow lip... 
 and rare  
 'Eye of the Tiger' 
 is dramatic with purple and dark-red petals. 
 You'll find good-quality bulbs for sale at garden centers and online nurseries that specialize in flower bulbs. 
 Buy Dutch iris bulbs that are firm -- not soft or mushy. Don't buy any that are sprouting. 
  
 How to Force Dutch Iris Bulbs - Step by Step 
  
 Dutch irises need a cold treatment for 8 weeks. 
 Start the process in October or November for mid-winter blooms. 
 Choose a shallow pot (at least 3 in/7 cm deep) with drainage holes in the bottom. Fill the pot loosely with potting mix. Set several bulbs side by side -- close but not touching -- pointed end up. Set bulbs so that their tips are even with pot rim. Top with additional potting mix until just barely covered. 
 Water thoroughly and empty drainage saucer. 
 Move pot to a dark, cool, but not freezing, (35-45°F/2-7°C) location such as a basement, unheated garage or refrigerator. Avoid storing bulbs near ripening fruit or vegetables because the ethylene gas they produce can damage them. Keep them in cold storage for about 8 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist. 
 When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, bring the pot out of cold storage and place it in a warmer (60°F/16°C) location with low light intensity. Over the next few days, gradually move it toward a sunny window. Turn the pot every day for even growth. When in full bloom, keep irises in a sunny location. 
  
 Dutch Iris Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
 These hybrids are bred in the Netherlands and are a cross between Spanish and African irises 
 Height: 
 Up to 24 in (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Keep in a dark location during cold treatment. Cover pot with a box, pot or black garbage bag if necessary. 
 After shoots appear, move to bright light with some direct sun as directed above. 
 Water: 
 Water sparingly until growth appears, then water enough to keep soil evenly moist. Soggy soil will 
 cause bulbs to rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). It's best to use a cool-mist room humidifier if the air is dry in winter. 
 Temperature: 
 After the cold treatment (see "how to force" above), cool to average 60-65°F/10-18°C. 
 Iris blooms will last longer if kept at 
 a maximum of 65°F/18°C. 
 Soil: 
 Any good potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half from planting until start of blooming. 
 Do not fertilize while plants are in bloom. 
 Propagation: 
 Irises cannot be forced a second time indoors. If you want to keep them, allow the foliage 
 to die back naturally, then store them in a cool, dry place. Plant the bulbs in a sunny spot in 
 your flower garden in the fall. Dutch irises are hardy to Zone 5 and naturally bloom in early summer. Dutch iris bulbs multiply 
 rapidly, so you'll enjoy a profusion of these captivating irises.

 Dwarf Chenille Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Acalypha pendula 
 Dwarf Chenille Plant gets its common name from the fuzzy plumes of tiny red flowers that trail above a thick 
 mound of small, serrated leaves. Given enough light, this plant blooms nearly year-round.

 This is a dwarf variety that stays small and doesn't need pruning. It's naturally bushy, so you don't have to 
 pinch its growing tips to get it to branch out. 
 Shed some light. 
  Bright light is essential to getting this plant to bloom. 
 Dwarf Chenille blooms most heavily summer through fall. If it doesn't bloom much, move it to where it will get direct morning sun and/or 
 indirect afternoon sun from a south- or west-facing window. 
 Deadhead flowers. 
  Pinch off flowers as soon as 
 they start to fade. Deadheading will encourage many more blooms. 
 Keep it well-watered and fertilized during the growing season. This tropical houseplant also appreciates high humidity. 
 You can place the pot on a tray of wet pebbles to raise the humidity around it. Or use a cool-mist room humidifier near Dwarf Chenille Plant 
 . 
 Raising the humidity also helps to prevent  
 spider mites 
  
 from invading. Watch out for these pests, especially in winter when indoor air tends to get dry. Dull-looking, speckled leaves and webbing are the first tell-tale signs of an infestation. 
 Repot in spring 
  only when it has outgrown its container. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy 
 soil. 
 I can understand why Dwarf Chenille Plant would appeal to cats, who may be tempted to play with its tassel-like blooms. 
 However this member of the Euphorbia family is known for its poisonous plants, so it's a good idea to keep it away from 
 pets. 
  
 Display Tip 
  
 Place this unusual house plant on a pedestal stand or pot it in a hanging basket to show off those eye-catching fuzzy blooms. 
  
  
 Dwarf Chenille Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Java and New Guinea 
 Height: 
 Up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light in summer; 4 hours direct sun per day in winter. Plants won't bloom without lots of sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist. Do not let it dry out. 
 Give this plant plenty of water in summer. It's a good idea to check the soil moisture 
 every 2-3 days when the plant is growing and blooming. Reduce water during the winter months, when growth is slower. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim to maintain moderate to high, 50-60% relative humidity year-round. 
 It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor rather than guess. Closed-up homes and central heating can make indoor air extremely dry in winter. The most efficient way to boost humidity for tropical plants is to use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm 65-85°F/18-29°C year-round 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer diluted by 
 half. 
 Propagation: 
 Easy to propagate from stem cuttings. Take 3 in (8 cm) stem cuttings in spring and root in 
 equal parts all-purpose potting mix and perlite. Keep cuttings in indirect sunlight and maintain an even 75°F/24°C until cuttings are rooted. It's a good idea to use a seedling heat mat to ensure constant warmth day and night.

 Growing Iris Plants Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Iris reticulata 
  
 Imagine growing mini iris plants on your sunny windowsill in the middle of winter. These petite flowers grow 
 from bulbs, not rhizomes as many irises do, and are easy to force in a container. 
  
  
  
  
 All irises are exquisite for their graceful form and symmetry, with 3 inner petals that stand upright 
 and 3 outer petals, called falls. 
 Iris reticulata 
 'Harmony' (shown at right) is one of the most popular dwarf iris varieties. I think it is 
 among the most captivating flowers you can grow indoors -- or out. And, there's more. Those richly colored blooms are 
 also sweetly scented. 
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 Buy iris bulbs that are firm -- not soft or mushy. Don't buy any that are sprouting. 
 You'll find good-quality iris bulbs for sale at garden centers and online nurseries that specialize in flower bulbs. 
 Many miniature iris varieties are available to choose from... 
 'Harmony' is one of the most popular in brilliant blue with a golden-yellow lip... 
 'Pixie' has deep violet-blue flowers...'J.S. Dijit' is dark purple...and 'Alida' is 
 a newer cultivar with large flowers and a mid-blue hue. 
  
 How to Force Dwarf Iris Bulbs - Step by Step 
  
 These mini irises need a cold treatment for 8 weeks. 
 Start the process in October or November for mid-winter blooms. 
 Choose a shallow pot (about 6 in/15 cm deep) with drainage holes in the bottom. Plant iris bulbs 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) deep. Go ahead and crowd the bulbs, setting them side by side, pointed end up. 
 Water thoroughly and empty drainage saucer. 
 Move pot to a dark, cool, but not freezing (35-45°F/2-7°C) location such as a basement, unheated garage or refrigerator. Avoid storing bulbs near ripening fruit or vegetables because the ethylene gas they produce can damage them. Keep them in cold storage for about 8 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist. 
 When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, bring the pot out of cold storage and place it in a warmer (60°F/16°C) location that gets at least 4 hours of sunlight per day. Give the pot a quarter turn every day for even growth. When in full bloom, keep irises in a sunny location. 
 Your beautiful iris plants should burst into bloom in about 2 weeks. Make them last longer by keeping the flowers as cool 
 as possible -- 
 no warmer than 60°F/16°C. 
 Even with cool temps, your flowers will only last about 5-10 days. 
  
 Tips for Growing Iris Plants Indoors 
  
  
 Origin: 
  High mountains of Iran and Turkey 
 Height: 
 6-10 in (15-25 cm) 
 Light: 
 Keep in a dark location during cold treatment. Cover pot with a box, pot or black garbage bag if necessary. 
 After shoots appear, move to bright light with some direct sun as directed above. 
 Water: 
 Water sparingly until growth appears, then water enough to keep soil evenly moist. Soggy soil will 
 cause bulbs to rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
 After the cold treatment, cool to average 60-65°F/10-18°C. If those temps are 
 too teeth-chattering for you, find a cool windowsill or sun porch. 
 Soil: 
 All-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half from planting until start of blooming. 
 Do not fertilize while plants are in bloom. 
 Propagation: 
 Bulbs. Irises cannot be forced a second time indoors. If you want to keep them, allow the foliage 
 to die back naturally, cut off the stems, then store the bulbs in a cool, dry place. Plant the bulbs in a sunny site with 
 well-drained soil in the fall. Dwarf iris plants are hardy to Zone 5 and naturally bloom in early spring.

 Easter Lily Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Lilium longiflorum 
  
 With a few Easter lily care tips, you'll keep your flowers fresh for 3-4 weeks or more. 
  
  
  
 Pristine white trumpets of the Easter Lily plant herald the holiday. 
  
 Pots of big, beautiful trumpet-shaped blooms are a traditional Easter decoration or gift. The pristine white flowers symbolize purity and life.  
 Are you buying an Easter lily? Choose a plant with plenty of unopened buds and you'll enjoy at least a month of fresh flowers. Avoid plants that look wilted -- a sign of over- or under-watering. 
  
  
 Here are some tips to get the most out of your potted lilies. 
 When you bring your potted plant home, take off the plastic sleeve right away to provide good air circulation. 
 Also remove the foil covering from the pot so that the drainage holes are not blocked. Easter lily won't tolerate soggy soil, which will cause the bulb to rot. 
 Cut off spent flowers to keep your plant looking its best and to coax more blooms. 
  
 Prolong the Bloom 
  
  
 As soon as the flowers open all the way, cut off the anthers.  
 This will prolong the life of the flower and also prevent the pollen from falling on the furniture or floor. 
  
  
 Easter lily bulbs won't bloom again indoors. If you want to keep them, you can replant the bulbs outside. They're cold-hardy to Zone 5. Although professional greenhouse growers force them into bloom before the spring holiday, you can expect your lilies to bloom outdoors in early summer, their natural bloom time. 
  
 Tips for Planting and Growing Easter Lilies Outdoors 
  
 Plant your bulbs in the garden as soon as danger of frost has passed. Don't store them because lily bulbs don't go dormant. 
 Choose a bright location where the plants will get at least a few hours of direct sun. 
 Plant the bulbs 6 inches (15 cm) deep in rich, well-drained soil, 12 inches (30 cm) apart. 
 Water well and fertilize once a month in spring and summer. 
 Deadhead flowers as they fade and cut stems back after the foliage has turned yellow. 
 Mulch plants in cold climates in winter to protect them. Remember to remove the mulch covering in spring to allow the new shoots to grow. 
 When planted outside, and with good Easter lily care, you'll enjoy flowers for years to come. 
  
 Easter Lily Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Japan 
 Height: 
  To 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright, indirect light indoors 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist while it is in bloom. It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole to avoid soggy soil, which can cause the bulb to rot. Empty drainage tray so that pot is not standing in water. 
 Humidity: 
  Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
 Keep your lily plant on the cool side to help prolong the blooms. A room temperature of 60-65°/16-18°C is ideal. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Not necessary unless you transplant the bulbs outdoors. Feed monthly with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Bulbs

 Firecracker Flower 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Crossandra infundibuliformis 
  
 Firecracker flower makes a stunning house plant that blooms dependably from spring through fall. 
  
  
  
  
 Orange flowers are most common, but other colors include salmon-red, yellow and pink. The flowers are held upright 
 from green tubular bracts. Even young plants are eager to bloom, sending up clusters of flowers most of the year. 
 Flower colors are available in orange, yellow, pink and red. 'Mona Wallhead' has salmon pink flowers... 
 'Lutea' has golden yellow flowers. 
 Its deeply veined, glossy leaves grow in opposite pairs, growing up to 5 in (13 cm) long. 
  
 In its native tropical habitat, this firecracker plant flourishes in the year-round warm temperatures and high humidity. 
 Dropped leaves are sometimes a symptom of being exposed to cold air. Keep this flowering plant away from windows, doors or 
 A/C vents, where it may be exposed to blasts of cold air. 
 If the leaf tips turn brown,  
 raise the humidity 
  around it. 
  
 Did you know... 
  
 Crossandra infundibuliformis 
  is in the Acanthaceae family. 
 This attractive clan boasts more than 2,000 species. Many are popular house plants, including Zebra Plant, 
 Polka Dot Plant and Persian Shield. What many 
 of them have in common is a brightly colored flower spike. Others have showy foliage. Some have both. 
  
  
 Repot in spring. Keep this flowering plant in a small pot because it blooms best when its roots are crowded. Use 
 a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil. 
 Deadhead spent blooms. After the last flower on any flower spike dies, cut off the flower spike. Deadheading will promote more flowers. 
 Watch for 
 spider mites 
 that like dry conditions. Treat any infestation right away to avoid these pests from moving on to your other indoor plants. 
 Raising the humidity around the plant discourages spider mites from invading. 
 Firecracker flowers make a beautiful addition to a group of other tropical plants. 
 Bringing them together as a group helps to raise the humidity around them. 
  
  
 Firecracker Flower Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Southern India and Sri Lanka 
 Height: 
 Up to 16 in (40 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light. Some direct morning sun is fine, but keep shaded from hot midday sunlight.  
 Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. 
 Move the plant to a brighter location where it will get filtered sunlight. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, allowing the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. Don't allow the 
 soil to get soggy because it will quickly kill the plant. Water less in winter, while plant is not actively growing. Remember to always use room-temperature water to water your tropical house plants; cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high (around 50% relative humidity or above). Using a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  is the most effective way to increase moisture in the air. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round. This tropical native doesn't like the cold at all -- don't expose it to temps lower than 65°F/18°C. Also, keep Firecracker Flower out of cold blasts from windows, doorways and AC vents. Cold drafts may cause leaves to fall off. 
 Soil: 
  All-purpose houseplant potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and pot them separately. Keep cuttings warm, lightly moist, and give them indirect sunlight. 
 Crossandra infundibuliformis 
 can also be grown from seed. Sow seeds in spring, barely covering them with moist potting mix. Use a seedling heat mat to maintain an even 70°F/21°C.

 Firecracker Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Russelia equisetiformis 
  
 Firecracker plant is a weeping shrub bursting with long sprays of orange-red flowers that lend it its name. 
 Other common names include coral plant and coral fountain plant. 
  
  
  
  
 The narrow, tubular flowers are about 1 in (2.5 cm) long and cover the plant from late spring till fall. Actually, 
 it can flower any time of year, given enough warmth and light. You'll get the most blooms by putting it in full sun. 
 Moving it outdoors for the summer is ideal. It's attractive to passersby as well 
 as to butterflies and hummingbirds. 
 This is a frost-tender plant. In fact, it doesn't do well in cold temperatures, so be sure to bring it 
 back indoors when the temperature drops in autumn. 
 Russelia equisetiformis 
 may be hard to find in garden centers, but is available for sale online. 
 Many colors are available: red, yellow, orange, white and pink. Some popular named varieties include 
 'Salmon Pink', 'Yellow Gold' and 'Tangerine Falls'. 
 Show it off. 
  Display your firecracker plant in a large hanging basket and allow 
 it to cascade, showing off the fine-textured foliage covered with bright flower clusters. Give it some space, too. 
 This spectacular, many-branching shrub can spread as wide as it is tall. 
 Prune it back. 
 By pruning off stems that have already flowered, you'll get more flowers! Cut off 
 spent flower stems at the base anytime. To keep your plant a manageable size, prune it back hard in early spring. 
 Bring it in. 
 This shrub is an evergreen perennial that's frost-tender. Unless you live in a year-round warm climate, expect 
 to overwinter it indoors. Keep it in a warm, sunny location. Reduce watering because growth will slow down in winter. 
  
 Firecracker Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico 
 Height: 
 3-6 ft (90 cm - 1.8 m) tall; trails to 6 ft (1.8 m) 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. 
 Firecracker plants require lots of light to bloom. Move it outdoors 
 for the summer and set it in the sunniest spot you can provide. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, allowing the top of the soil to dry out between waterings. Mature plants 
 are drought-tolerant, so it's a good idea to keep them on the dry side. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity) 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. If you move your plant outside 
 for the warm months, don't worry -- it can take the heat. It's hardy in USDA Zones 9b-11. However, it won't tolerate freezing temperatures. 
 Soil: 
 All-purpose potting mix with a little added perlite or sand for quick drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 In winter, feed monthly. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem tip cuttings in spring.

 Flame Violet -  
 Episcia cupreata 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Episcia cupreata 
 Flame violet is prized for its showy leaves that grow in a rosette and reach 2-3 in (5-8 cm) long. They combine 
 shades of green and coppery brown, often with light green or silver veins. Leaves have a metallic-like sheen 
 that make this plant irresistible. 
  
  
  
 Episcia cupreata is a relative of the African violet. Both are in the Gesneriaceae family. 
  
 You can expect bright flowers to appear in spring and continue through fall. Dainty, tubular flowers rise above 
 the foliage and are typically red, but may be available in orange, pink or yellow. They flare out at the tips like 
 trumpets and are sometimes fringed at the edges. Deep in the center of the trumpet is a yellow eye. 
  
 E. cupreata 'Chocolate Soldier' cultivar. 
  
 Place  
 Episcia cupreata 
  near a window, but away from direct sunlight, which can scorch its leaves. Also keep 
 your plant away from heat vents or cold blasts from doors and windows. 
 Repot in spring every couple years to refresh the soil. Flame violet has shallow roots and a spreading habit, 
 so a wide, shallow pot works best. Or, you can put the plant in a hanging basket and allow the stems to trail 
 over the side of the pot. 
 Look for  
 aphids 
  on the stems and undersides of leaves. These tiny pests are attracted to new growth on a young plant. Also watch for  
 fungus gnats 
  that are attracted to moist, peaty potting mixes. Treat any infestation immediately. 
  
 Episcia cupreata 
  Varieties 
  
 You have an abundance of named hybrids to choose from. 
  
 'Chocolate Soldier' has dark foliage with silver veining. 'Tropical Topaz' is light green with yellow flowers. 'Silver Sheen' has silver-gray, crinkled leaves and red blooms. 
 These are just a few -- spectacular new cultivars are being introduced with more colors and patterns than we've ever seen. 
  
 Episcia cupreata 'Silver Skies' 
  
 Flame Violet Care 
  
 Origin: 
  Colombia and Venezuela 
 Height: 
  6 in (15 cm) tall 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. 
 Flame violets that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. Place your plant near a bright window, 
 but out of direct sun. Like its African Violet cousin, 
 Episcia cupreata  
 grows well under artificial light. 
 Water: 
 Water regularly to keep soil evenly moist spring through fall. Keep slightly drier in winter when growth is slowed. 
 Humidity: 
  
 High humidity is a must. 
 If relative humidity drops below 50%,  
 use a 
  
 pebble tray 
 or room humidifier 
 for your plant. 
 Don't use a mister because the leaves will spot and are prone to fungus. 
 If the leaves get brown edges and flower buds shrivel without opening, 
 the air is too dry. 
 Temperature: 
 Prefers cool temperatures, especially while in bloom; 55-65°F/13-18°C at 
 night/not warmer than 75°F/24°C during the day. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based mix with added perlite for faster drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with African violet fertilizer. Do not feed in winter. 
 Propagation: 
 Take single leaf stem cuttings in spring. Dip the cut end in water, then 
 rooting hormone powder 
 . Put the stem in moist potting mix, then firm the mix around the 
 stem so that it stands up. Enclose the whole pot in plastic to hold in humidity. Roots should develop 
 in about a month, and you should see plantlets form from the base of the cutting about 
 a month after that.

 Flamingo Flower 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Anthurium scherzerianum 
  
 Flamingo Flower is well-known by its red, oval spathes, each with a twisted, orange 
 spadix covered densely with its tiny, true flowers. Spathes last for up to 8 weeks. 
  
  
  
  
 Large pointed, dark-green leaves grow up to 7 in (18 cm) long and surround the upright flower stems. 
 Anthurium leaves are poisonous 
 . They contain calcium oxalate crystals that can cause severe burning 
 in the mouth. Keep your flamingo plant away from pets who may play with or chew on its foliage. 
 It's also a good idea to wear gloves when handling anthurium plant to avoid skin irritation. 
 You'll find anthurium growing in warm, tropical regions. This Central America native prefers bright light, moist 
 soil and moist air. Newer cultivars are less fussy about humidity and many hybrids are more lush, compact, and will 
 bloom nearly year-round, taking a break in winter. 
 Repot a young plant in spring 
 when its roots have filled the container. Set the plant high so that 
 the crown sits above the soil line. If roots appear at the surface between repottings, cover them with potting mix. 
 Move your anthurium plant to a pot only 1 size larger. Be sure to use a pot with a drainage hole. Good drainage is essential 
 to prevent root rot. 
 Keep leaves clean. 
 Anthurium leaves are naturally glossy. Gently wipe them with a damp cloth, or spray with a fine mist of room-temperature water, to keep them dust-free. Avoid leaving water drops on the leaves because it may cause a fungus that appears as 
 dry, brown spots 
 that need to be treated with a fungicide. 
  
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Peaty potting mixes that are kept moist often attract  
 fungus gnats 
 . They look like tiny, black flies that crawl on the surface of the potting medium. You can prevent them by allowing the top surface of the medium to dry out before watering again. 
 Yellow leaves 
  are typically caused by overwatering. They can also indicate the plant is too cold; remember, this tropical native likes the same warm temperatures that we do.  
 Yellow leaves with brown tips 
  may be a sign of too much fertilizer.  
 Brown leaf tips 
  usually are caused by dry air; raise the humidity around your plant. 
 Few blooms 
 ? 
  As I said before, newer cultivars are loaded with colorful spathes most of the year. If your Flamingo Flower isn't flowering, it is either not getting enough sunlight, or not enough phosphorous. (See "light" and "fertilizer" tips below.) 
  
 Flamingo Flower Buying Tips 
  
 You can order these tropical flowers online from flower delivery sites and nurseries. 
 Many named cultivars are available to choose from, including some with dark red, pink or white spathes. 
 'Rothschildeanum' has a red spathe with white spots. 'Wardii' has a dark red spathe. 
 This is a beautiful, lush tropical plant even when not in bloom. Give your anthurium growing  
 conditions like its native habitat, and you'll enjoy it for several years. 
  
 Flamingo Flower Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Costa Rica 
 Height: 
 12-18 inches (30-45 cm). Flower stalks may need staking. 
 Light: 
 Bright light, but no direct sun. 
 Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. 
 Move the plant near a window where it gets 
 bright light, out of direct sun. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist in spring and summer, while plant is actively growing. Water less often in fall and winter, but don't allow potting medium to dry out. Yellow leaves may be a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high. Use a  
 humidity tray or a room humidifier 
  if 
 the relative humidity drops below 50%. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-75°F/18-24°C. Flamingo Flower grows best with even temperatures year-round. Exposing it to 
 temperatures below 60°F/10°C can cause its leaves to turn yellow. It doesn't like drafts either; it's a good idea to keep Anthurium away from air vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix with added perlite. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by 
 half. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide crowded clumps when repotting, and pot them separately in small pots. Spring is the best time to start new plants. High 
 humidity will give them a good start. Your young plants should begin flowering in about a year.

 Florist Chrysanthemum 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Chrysanthemum morifolium 
  
 Florist Chrysanthemum has big, beautiful flowers crowning a mass of dark-green foliage. This is a member of 
 the Asteraceae family, along with daisies, sunflowers and marigolds. 
 Chrysanthemum gets its name from the Greek words 
 chryos 
 , meaning gold, and 
 anthemom 
 , meaning flower. These "golden flowers" are now available in shades of pink, purple, red, burgundy, white, and yes -- golden yellow. 
  
  
  
  
 Florist mums are not hardy for growing outdoors in cold climates. Tender potted mums sold in florist shops want to stay indoors with you. 
 Choose a plant with plenty of buds that are just beginning to open. If your florist chrysanthemums came with a plastic covering over the pot, remove it. Your mums need plenty of air circulation. Plus, you don't want to block the nursery pot's drainage holes. 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 The secret to keeping blossoms fresh for several weeks is to keep mums in a cool place and well-watered. 
  
  
 You can cover a plain nursery pot by slipping it into a 
 cachepot 
 -- a decorative pot without drainage holes. I put pebbles in the bottom of cachepots to keep the pot above the drainage water. 
  
 Growing Mums Indoors: Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Buds won't open? 
  Give your plant plenty of sunshine to ensure blooming. Flowering plants may look cheerful near an inside wall or in a sunless hallway, but they won't bloom well there. Give them light. 
 Wilted plants are likely thirsty. 
  Florist mums are often root-bound -- their pots are packed with roots, with little soil to hold water. You can revive dry roots by setting the pot in a pan of water for at least 30 minutes, allowing it to drink up, while also watering from the top. Keep a close eye on mums; you may need to water every day or two. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
   
 Aphids 
  sometimes arrive with a newly purchased plant. Green and wedge-shaped, they are tiny and difficult to spot, but they can do a lot of damage. Look for them along the stems and undersides of leaves. Treat any infestation right away to prevent them from invading your other houseplants. 
 Are mums toxic? 
  Yes -- Chrysanthemum leaves are poisonous. Keep out of the reach of children and pets that may play with 
 or ingest this plant. 
  
  
 Instant Style for Your Home 
  
 Lend any room fresh, seasonal color with a potted mum. Or group a few pots for a big splash of color. 
 Florist chrysanthemums are also a stand-out among your green houseplants. Those bright bunches of blooms are even more showy when surrounded by big-leaved dieffenbachia, split-leaf philodendron and monstera. Contrasting sizes, forms and textures complement each other when displayed together. 
  
 Temporary Houseguest 
  
 Give your plant a cool, bright location, and you can expect blooms for about 6 to 8 weeks. 
 Unfortunately, it's difficult to get mums to rebloom, so it is treated as an annual and tossed out after the blooming season is 
 over. You can put your plant outdoors in the spring to possibly get another season of blooms, but it will never look as good. Don't feel guilty about discarding your plant when it's past its prime. 
  
  
 Beautiful Air-Cleaners 
  
 Although temporary houseguests, beautiful florist chrysanthemums work hard at removing air pollutants found in homes caused 
 by the chemicals in upholstery, paint and carpet. 
 Florist mums are one of the best flowering plants for purifying indoor air of formaldehyde, benzene and ammonia. Find 
 out more about  
 air-cleaning house plants 
 . 
  
 Florist Chrysanthemum Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  China 
 Height: 
 12-24 in (30-60 cm); commercial growers treat plants with chemicals to stunt their growth, keeping them compact 
 Light: 
 Bright light. Flower buds may fail to open without enough sunlight. Direct morning light is fine, but keep your mums out of direct afternoon sun because they can't take the heat. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist at all times. Foliage will wilt and flower buds won't open if the roots are too dry. Flowering plants are thirsty, so check the soil often. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40-50% relative humidity). If indoor air is dry, try one of these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool temperatures 55-65°F/13-18°C; Flowers may not last as long if kept in a warm room. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 N/A 
 Propagation: 
 Stem cuttings

 Flowering Maple Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Abutilon hybridum 
  
 Flowering maple flourishes when given the same conditions as its native tropical habitat. Bright light and warmth 
 will make it thrive in your home -- and flower most of the year. 
  
  
  
  
 Maple leaf-shaped foliage lends one of its common names. Sometimes called Chinese lantern plants because of the 
 shape of the drooping papery flowers. 
 You can expect the big, bell-shaped flowers of red, pink, orange, yellow or peach to cover flowering maples from spring through fall. 
 Abutilon 
  is a member of the Malvaceae family, along with mallows and hollyhocks. This 
 genus includes more than 100 beautiful flowering shrubs. In its native habitat, it can 
 grow up to 10 ft (3 m) tall. Indoors, it's a good idea to keep it around 2-3 ft (60-90 cm). 
 Flowering maple responds well to pruning, so don't be afraid to cut it back harshly in spring -- removing up to a third of the plant. 
 Prune back in the spring, before the most 
 vigorous growth begins. Pruning  
 Abutilon 
  regularly will keep the plant small and prevent it from becoming leggy. 
 Also, 
 pinch off growing tips to promote branching. 
  
  
 Flowering maples have long been popular houseplants. In fact, they'll thrive in pots as long as you can meet their needs for sunlight, warmth and moisture. 
  
 Water thoroughly 
 . Uneven watering can result in dry pockets in the soil. Dry roots will quickly cause the plant to wilt, 
 and it may drop its leaves and flowers. Always use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. 
 Shed some light 
 . Flowering maple needs plenty of light to bloom. Put it in front of a 
 sunny window. You can move it outdoors for the warm months, if you want. Just be sure to shade it from hot, midday sun. 
 Repot in spring 
 , when you see new growth. This plant blooms best when slightly pot-bound, so 
 move it to a pot 1 size larger only when necessary. 
 Watch for bugs 
 .  
 Aphids 
  may attack new growth on this plant, leaving a sticky residue on leaves. Another pest to watch for is  
 spider mites 
 . Although difficult to see, you'll notice their fine webbing between leaves and stems. 
  
  
 Abutilon Hybrids and Cultivars 
  
 You can buy Flowering Maple plants in garden centers and online flower delivery sites. You have lots of beautiful 
 varieties to choose from. 
 'Red Glory' 
 is a prolific bloomer... 
 'Pink Lady' 
 has bright-pink flowers marked with deep-pink veins... 
 'Apricot Glow' 
 has golden flowers. 
 Some varieties have yellow mottled foliage, such as 
 A. pictum 
  
 'Thompsonii' 
 and 
 'Gold Dust' 
 . 
  
  
 Flowering Maple Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) if not pruned back. Prune regularly to keep the plant at a maximum of 3 ft (90 cm). 
 Tall plants will need staking. 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. Shade from direct midday sun. 
 Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough sun. 
 Put your plant in the brightest window possible. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, then allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Use a pot with drainage holes, then empty drainage tray to prevent soggy soil which can lead to root rot. If this plant gets too dry, it will quickly wilt. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate, around 40-50% relative humidity. Indoor humidity can drop drastically during the winter months. It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor near your plant rather than guess. The most efficient way to  
 boost moisture for houseplants 
  is to use a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm (65-80°F/18-27°C). These tropical natives 
 don't like the cold at all. If you move your plant outdoors for the summer, bring it back inside if the 
 temperature dips below 55°F/13°C at night. Cold temps may cause flowering maple to drop its 
 leaves and go dormant for the winter. 
 Soil: 
 Use a peat moss-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring. Dip the cut ends in  
 rooting powder 
  
 and plant the cuttings in moist soil.

 How to Grow Freesia Flower Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Freesia 
  hybrids 
 Freesia flower is often sold as cut flowers in florist's shops. You can enjoy their beautiful, highly fragrant blooms 
 even longer, though, if you grow freesias yourself as house plants. 
  
  
  
 Beautifully fragrant freesias are also easy to grow indoors. Image by  
 Manfred Richter 
  
 Funnel-shaped freesia flowers are sweetly-scented and available in single- and double-flowered varieties. Hybrids offer 
 a big range of gorgeous colors -- lavender, pink, orange, red, yellow, white and bicolors. Surrounding the flower 
 stems are long, strap-like leaves. 
 Freesia bulbs are actually  
 corms 
 , and are easy to grow indoors. They are warm-natured, meaning corms don't need a cold treatment to bloom; the corms are ready to plant. 
 Choose corms that are firm -- not soft or mushy. Don't buy any that are sprouting. After waiting for months for freesia flower to bloom, you 
 don't want to be disappointed. 
  
 When to Plant Freesia Bulbs 
  
 Start planting freesia in late summer or early 
 fall for winter or early-spring blooms. You can pot them up every couple weeks for a succession of flowers to enjoy for months. 
  
 Freesia is a genus in the Iridaceae family, along with iris, gladiolus and crocus. Photo T. Wolter 
  
 How to Grow Freesia Bulbs Indoors - Step by Step 
  
  
 Choose a shallow pot (at least 3 in/7 cm deep) with drainage holes in the bottom. Fill the pot loosely with potting mix. Set corms 2 in (5 cm) apart, pointed end up. Do not press the corms into the mix, keep it loose so the roots can grow through it easily. Top corms with 1 in (2.5 cm) of additional potting mix. 
  
 Water minimally until you see new growth. 
  
 Move pot to a bright, warm (80°F/27°C) location such as a sunroom for about 8 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist. 
  
 When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, move the pot to a cooler (60-65°F/16-18°C) room in a bright window for a couple weeks until flower buds form. Turn the pot every couple days for even growth. When in full bloom, keep freesias in a bright location out of direct sun to prolong the bloom. 
  
  
 What to Do After Flowering is Over 
  
 After all the flowers are spent, reduce watering and 
 allow the foliage to die back naturally. 
  
 When the foliage turns brown, stop watering. Then cut them off. Lift the corms out of the potting medium and store them in a dry, warm (80°F/17°C) place for at least 3 months. Corms need at least a 3-month rest before they can be started again. 
 Any rotten or corky corms likely have dry rot and should be discarded. 
  
 Freesia Flower Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Leaning stems 
 are likely stretching toward the sunlight. It's a good idea to turn the pot every few days, or as necessary, to expose all sides to light. Also, it's not unusual to stake up flowering freesias because they get top heavy and flop over. 
 Shriveled, quickly fading blooms 
  are caused by too-high temperatures. 
 Make freesia last longer by keeping the plant in a slightly cooler location. Blooms will last for months if kept at 
 a maximum of 65°F/18°C. 
 Something bugging your freesias? 
   
 Aphids 
  are attracted to new growth; look for these insects on leaves and stems and treat any infestation right away.  
 Red spider mites 
  sometimes attack indoor plants in winter because they like dry conditions. Raising the humidity will help to prevent them. 
 Are freesias poisonous? 
  No. While it's not a good idea to allow cats and dogs to chew on plants, you don't have to worry about this one -- it's non-toxic. 
  
 Freesia Flower Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 Up to 18 in (46 cm). Flower stems often need to be staked to hold them upright. 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect sunlight. Some cool, direct morning sunlight is fine. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil lightly moist. Don't overwater because it will cause the corms to rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate -- around 40-50% relative humidity. If indoor air is dry, discover these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  Warm temperatures 80°F/27°C until corms start sprouting, then keep cool 60-65°F/16-18°C 
 while freesia plant is growing and flowering. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix with added horticultural sand for faster drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks, beginning with the first show of flower buds till the end of flowering. 
 Use a high-phosphorus water-soluble 
 fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Repot corms each year, following "How to Grow Freesia" steps above. Corms grow offsets that can be separated and potted.

 Fuchsia Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Fuchsia x hybrida 
  
 Good fuchsia plant care will reward you with a long-blooming season. Whether you put these gorgeous flowers indoors or 
 on your shaded patio -- you'll enjoy their magnificent blooms from spring through late fall. And they're perennials, so 
 you can keep them year after year. 
  
  
  
  
 The blooms are spectacular, with 4 flared sepals (that's the top part of the 
 bloom) often in a contrasting color to the bell-shaped petals. The petals may be single, semi-double or double, with stamens and 
 pistils extending from the blooms. Thousands of hybrids offer rich colors to choose from -- in any combination of white, pink, red, lavender, or purple. 
 Some varieties have an upright habit. But those most often sold in garden centers and nurseries are trailing -- making a cascading 
 fuchsia basket. 
  
 Year-Round Fuchsia Tips 
  
  
 Shed some (indirect) light. 
 Fuchsias make easy indoor plants, if you can provide the bright light they need to grow. 
 Place your fuchsia plant near a window, where it'll get filtered sunlight. Moving your plant outdoors for the summer will really 
 help it to thrive. Just keep it in a shady spot and be sure to bring it back inside when the temperature drops below 45°F/7°C at night. 
 Fuchsias won't tolerate frost. 
 Pinch your plant. 
 In spring and early summer, pinch off growing tips to encourage the plant branch out. You'll have a 
 fuller fuchsia plant this way. You can propagate those stem tips, if you want, for more plants. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Prune stems in early spring to promote vigorous new growth and to give your plant 
 and attractive shape. Take care not to cut off any flower buds while pruning. Use sharp pruners and cut at a 45° angle 
 above a leaf axil. 
  
  
  
 Give it a rest. 
  Fuchsias go dormant in winter. Keep your plant in a cool place (with a minimum of 45°F/7°C). 
 Cut back on watering during this time, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Repot every spring. 
 Fuchsia plant blooms best when slightly pot 
 -bound, and it has shallow roots, so don't be in a big 
 hurry to move it to a larger pot. When the plant reaches the size you want, you can repot it in the same 
 container, just to refresh the soil. 
  
 Buying Fuchsia 
  
 Out of 100 species and 1,000s of cultivars, 
 Fuchsia x hybrida 
  is most  
 commonly grown for cultivation. It's a hybrid of  
 Fuchsia magellanica 
 and  
 F. fulgens 
 . 
  
 Newly purchased plants may drop their flowers when moved to a new location, so it's a good idea to choose a plant with 
 plenty of unopened flower buds. 
 Many cultivars are available. Fuchsia 'Little Charmer' is a miniature variety -- ideal for an indoor plant. 
 'Cascade' is striking with white sepals and bright red petals... 'Checkerboard' has red and white sepals with 
 red petals. 
 For hanging baskets...red-and-white 'Swingtime' and pink-and-lavender 'Starry Trail' are showy trailing fuchsias. 
  
 Fuchsia Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico, Argentina and Chile 
 Height: 
 Up to 3 ft (90 cm), dwarf varieties are much smaller. 
 Light: 
 Bright light, but no direct sun. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly spring through fall, keeping the soil evenly moist. Plants in hanging baskets dry 
 out quickly, so check them often especially if they're outside. Cut back on watering in the winter, while the plant is dormant. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim to maintain 40% relative humidity or higher. 
 Leaf and flower drop is probably caused by dry, hot air. 
 New plants that go from a humid greenhouse to a dry home are in shock and may shed its leaves and flowers.  
 Move your fuchsia plant to a cooler spot and  
 raise the humidity 
  around it by placing the pot on a tray of wet pebbles. 
 Temperature: 
 Keep it cool at night -- 50-55°F/10-13°C and warmer 60-70°F/16-21°C during the day. 
 Give it a cool rest in winter with a minimum temperature of 45°F/7°C. 
 Soil: 
 All-purpose good-quality potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with balanced water-soluble 
 fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (7 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root in moist potting mix.

 Indoor Gardenia Care Tips 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Gardenia jasminoides 
  
 Good gardenia care will ensure long-lasting blooms and a long-lived flowering house plant. 
 Beautiful, little gardenia shrubs make welcome gifts. If you buy a gardenia for a loved one, be sure to treat yourself, too. 
  
  
  
 Gardenia needs some attention year-round to thrive. But you won't mind. Gardenia's intoxicating fragrance and creamy white 
 blossoms make it all worthwhile. 
 As soon as flower buds appear, step up your game and give it the perfect growing conditions. Find a good place for 
 your gardenia in a well-lit area that's draft-free. Natural gas fumes will harm the plant, so growing 
 gardenias near a gas stove or fireplace isn't a good idea. 
 Gardenias enjoy spending the summer outdoors. 
 If you put it outside, keep it in a shady spot. Bring it back in if the temperature drops below 60°F. 
 Happy plants may bloom a second time in the fall. 
  
  
 Pruning gardenia plants in late winter will keep them in good shape. Cut the stem at an angle, just above a node 
 (the place where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem). Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems. 
 Repot in late winter. You can control its size by keeping it in a smallish container. In fact, gardenias are sometimes grown as bonsai plants. 
  
 How to Get those Beautiful Blooms 
  
 Cool nights (60°F) and warm days (75°F) will trigger flower buds. 
 Gardenia flowers need plenty of light to bloom. Place your plant where it will get several hours of bright, filtered light each day. 
 Flowering plants are thirsty. Dry soil will cause the buds to drop. Check the soil at least every couple days. Keep it moist but not soggy, which can also cause buds to drop. 
  
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 You'll find gardenia plants for sale in the spring and summer, when they're in bloom. 
 The most common gardenia for growing indoors is 'White Gem', a dwarf gardenia variety reaching only 2 ft (60 cm) tall. 
 If you want a bonsai, gardenia 'Radicans' has an upright form, making it a favorite for shaping a gardenia tree. 
  
 Gardenia Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  China 
 Height: 
 1-3 ft (30-90 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light. Some direct sunlight in winter is fine. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist during the growing season, slightly drier in winter. With gardenia 
 yellow leaves are usually caused by overwatering. Use a pot with a drainage hole and allow soil to dry slightly 
 between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
 Gardenias love humidity. Use a room humidifier or place the pot on a tray of wet pebbles. 
 Misting is also a good idea in summer. With gardenia care should be taken to mist the foliage, and not the flowers. 
 Temperature: 
 Normal room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C 
 Soil: 
 Lime-free acidic potting mix, such as a peat-moss based mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed gardenias during the growing season to keep them healthy and flowering. Use a fertilizer specially made for acid-loving plants. Feed every 2 weeks with a high-potassium fertilizer that contains iron, diluted by half. 
 Only fertilize when watering to avoid fertilizer burn. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3-inch (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. Dip cut ends in  
 hormone rooting powder 
 , then 
 place in moist potting mix. Cover the plant with a  
 cloche  
 or a plastic bag to maintain humidity.

 Whether you're growing geraniums indoors -- or outdoors on your sunny porch or patio --  
 Pelargonium 
  hybrids 
 can't be beat for spectacular vigor and bloom. 
 All summer, you can expect several flowerheads held on succulent stems to cover the plant. 
 The blooms may be single, semidouble or double, and are available in many shades of pink, salmon, red, purple or white. 
  
 Fancy Leaf Geraniums 
  
  
 Scalloped leaf edges and a brown, circular ring -- called a  
 zone 
  -- are the hallmarks of many  
 P. x hortorum 
 varieties. 
 These hybrids are often called zonal geraniums because of the zone leaf patterns. 
 Some zonal cultivars are grown just for their colorful foliage.  
 'Robert Fish' 
 has small, insignificant flowers, but its 
 red, yellow, brown and green leaves are magnificent. 
 'Henry Cox' 
 is another fancy-leafed geranium splashed with gold, red, bronze and green. 
  
 Caring for Geraniums Year-Round 
  
 Let the sun shine. 
  Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. Give your geranium as much light 
 as you can spring through fall, including direct sun. If you're growing geraniums indoors, put the plant in a sunny window. 
 Deadhead geranium flowers. 
  Remove spent flowers to keep your plant looking neat and to promote more blooms. 
 Pinch and prune. 
  Pruning geraniums will force new growth, bringing you more flowers. Use sharp pruners 
 and cut at a 45° angle to 
 avoid tearing the stems, which can attract disease. Cut stems back hard in spring to keep the plant compact. Pinching off 
 the growing tips will encourage branching. 
 Repot in spring. 
  Geraniums bloom best if slightly pot-bound. Move your plant to a pot 1 to 2 inches larger or 
 keep it in the same pot and just give it fresh soil. 
 Winterizing geraniums. 
  Saving geraniums from year to year requires a cool winter rest. These are tender perennials 
 that won't survive the frost. You can overwinter geraniums in a cool basement or garage with a minimum 
 temperature of 50°F/10°C. During this rest, water sparingly, but don't allow soil to dry out completely. Allow the 
 foliage to die back, then cut the stems back hard in spring. 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 Pale circles on leaves are caused by the fungus rust. 
 Cut off affected stems and leaves. If necessary, spray your plant with a sulfur-based fungicide made to treat rust disease. 
  
  
 With good geranium care, your plant will flower year after year. Geranium propagation from stem cuttings that root 
 readily or from seeds, can easily grow your collection of these gorgeous flowering plants.

 Buying Tip 
  
 You can buy geraniums in garden centers, nurseries and online in spring and summer. Dozens of new hybrids are offered every year, with 
 robust growth and superior flowering. The care of geraniums is easy, so pick as many as you like. 
  
 Geranium Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  1-3 ft (30-90 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun. 
 Growing geraniums in a sunny spot outdoors for the summer will give it more blooming power. 
 Just be sure to bring it back inside before the temperature drops to 50°F/10°C at night. 
 Try to move your plant back inside gradually. Move it to a shadier spot first to acclimate it to lower light levels. Sudden changes in 
 light will cause the leaves to drop off. When moving your geranium care should be taken not to brush against the 
 flowers because they can easily fall off. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, then allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out before watering again. Cut back on watering 
 in winter, but don't allow the roots to dry out completely. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which can 
 cause root rot. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity) or higher. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool nights (55-60°F/13-16°C) and warm days (65-75°F/18-24°C) will 
 trigger flower buds. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based soilless mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus fertilizer 
 to promote blooming. 
 Propagation: 
  Take stem cuttings in spring and early summer and root in fresh potting mix. Geranium seed is 
 easy to grow, too. Sow seeds in early spring.

 Gerbera Daisy Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Gerbera jamesonii 
  
 Gerbera daisy care is so easy, it's no wonder these eye-catching flowers have become must-have house plants. You'll find lots of colorful 
 gerbera daisy plants popping up in florist's shops in spring and summer. 
  
  
  
  
 Big, velvety gerbera flowers are showy and long-lasting. 
 They are held on thick, leafless stems above large, deeply veined 
 leaves. The leaves are about 6 in (15 cm) long and are soft and furry on the undersides. 
 You'll find gerberas for sale in spring and early summer. 
  
 Gerbera daisy colors range from soft pink, white and pale yellow to bright shades of pink, orange, purple and red. 
 Newer hybrids are compact  
 and produce up to 6 blooms at a time, 
 making them 
 ideal for growing indoors. 
 New plant? 
  When you bring home a fresh pot of gerbera daisies, remove the decorative wrapping on the pot as soon as possible. Excess water will collect in the foil or plastic sleeve rather than drain, waterlogging the roots. See "water" tips below. Want to cover up a plain nursery pot? Slip it into a cachepot -- a decorative container without drainage holes. It's a good idea to put small rocks in the bottom of cachepots to hold the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Breathe easier. 
  They're not only beautiful, gerber daisies are good for you, too. 
 Gerberas are among the best plants for improving indoor air quality. They have one of the top removal rates of toxins  
 such as formaldehyde and benzene from tainted indoor air.

 Gerbera Daisy Care: Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Give gerbera plant some air. 
 Allowing good air circulation around the plant will help to prevent  
 leaf spot 
 . 
 This fungus will show up on the leaves as brown spots surrounded by light-colored borders. Isolate the plant and 
 cut off any affected leaves. Treat with a fungicide made for leaf spot, if necessary. 
 Check for bugs. 
 Check your house plants regularly for  
 aphids 
 . 
 They tend to hang out on flower buds and stems. If you find 
 an infestation, treat your plant right away 
 because these little pests can harm your plants. Wet, peaty potting mixes sometimes attract  
 fungus gnats 
 ; they look like tiny, black flies that hop or crawl on the soil. 
 Get more blooms. 
  Once a flower fades, cut off the flower stem at the base of the plant. Called  
 deadheading 
 , removing spent flowers will encourage gerberas to keep blooming. 
 Don't overwater. 
  Is your gerbera daisy wilted? If you're watering regularly and the whole plant collapses anyway, it may have root rot. Ease the plant out of the container and take a peek at its roots. Are they soft, mushy and brown? If so, the plant has root rot. Toss it out -- it's too far gone. 
 Wondering whether  
 Gerbera jamesonii 
  is safe for cats and dogs? Don't worry -- it's non-toxic, according to the ASPCA. 
  
 Gerbera Daisy Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 Up to 2 ft (60 cm). Dwarf varieties are 6-12 in (15-30) tall. 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. 
 Put your gerbera daisy plant on a bright windowsill, where it will get some direct sunlight. Growing gerbera daisies on your patio is another option, as long as the temperature doesn't rise above 75°F/24°C. 
 Water: 
  
 Drench and dry. 
 Water thoroughly. With gerbera daisy care should be taken not to allow any dry pockets 
 around the roots, which can cause the plant to wilt. Water until you see water coming out the drainage hole and 
 discard any water left in the saucer. Don't water again until the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil is dry. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity) or higher. If your home is dry, use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  near your plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average 55-75°F/13-24°C  
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite for fast drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks while in bloom with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Division or seeds

 Glory Lily Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Gloriosa superba 
 'Rothschildiana' 
 Glory Lily is a perennial tropical flowering vine that makes a stunning, exotic house plant. 
  
  
  
  
 A vigorous climber, this  
 Gloriosa 
 hybrid grows 1 to 4 stems from each tuber. Along each slender stem are 
 shiny, narrow leaves with twining tendrils at their tips. 
 This vining lily will grasp at anything for climbing up. Providing its weak, wispy vines with a support 
 will give the tendrils something to cling to. Besides, you want to show off its beautiful foliage and flowers. 
 Those big, crimson-red flowers are nothing short of glorious. Growing from the leaf axils, the long 
 wavy petals are bright red with yellow at the base of the flower. Prominent stamens look like wheel 
 spokes beneath the 6 back-swept petals. You can expect flowers throughout the summer. 
 Gloriosa superba 
  'Rothschildiana' flowering plants may be difficult to find in garden centers.  
 Dormant tubers are available from online nurseries that specialize in flowering bulbs. 
  
  
 Caring for Glory Lily Year-Round 
  
 Give it support. 
 Train this tropical vine to climb a  
 trellis 
 . Glory Lily has tendrils 
 at the tips of its leaves that readily cling to a support. Use florist's wire to loosely hold the vine to a trellis 
 to get it started. You may have to adjust the wire as the vine grows. 
 Deadhead flowers. 
 Cut off spent flowers to keep the plant looking its best. Removing them 
 will also encourage the plant to produce more flowers. 
 Overwinter tubers. 
 After flowering is over, cut back on water to induce dormancy and allow the foliage to die back naturally. 
 Cut off withered stems and store tubers in their pots for the winter, in a dry, cool (around 60°F/16°C) 
 place until spring. Repot the tubers in fresh potting mix in spring for another season of gorgeous blooms. 
 Is glory lily poisonous? 
  Yes, all parts of this lily are poisonous. Don't keep this plant around children, cats or dogs. 
  
 Glory Lily Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Tropical Africa 
 Height: 
 Climbs to 4 ft (1.2 m) or more 
 Light: 
 This vigorous lily needs plenty of bright, indirect sunlight to bloom. 
 Water: 
 Keep evenly moist in spring and summer. Don't allow the medium to get soggy because tubers will rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high humidity.  
 Raise the humidity 
  around the lily with a cool-mist room humidifier 
 or setting the pot on a humidity tray. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix that drains well. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2-3 weeks with a high-phosphorous water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half while plant is 
 growing. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide offsets of tubers formed during the growing season, or sow seeds in spring. Pot each 
 tuber separately in a 6 in (15 cm) pot. Plant tubers 1 in (2.5 cm) below the surface of the soil. 
 Handle Gloriosa tubers carefully -- they're brittle and may break.

 Growing Florist Gloxinia Plant Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Sinningia speciosa 
  hybrids 
 Big, ruffled, bell-shaped blooms of florist gloxinia are available in a rich range of colors -- red, burgundy, pink, white, 
 violet and purple. 
 Some varieties have blooms edged in white, or have a contrasting spotted throat color. 
  
  
  
 Soft, velvety Gloxinia flowers put on a gorgeous show, with a bloom time lasting several weeks. 
  
 Velvety flowers are carried on slender stems above a rosette of large, oval, hairy leaves with scalloped edges. 
 Originally, these showy gloxinia flowers were only grown from tuberous roots that went dormant in the winter. The tubers were then replanted 
 for another seasonal show of flowers. Today, many gloxinias sold in florist shops were bred to grow from seed. These seed- 
 grown hybrids produce better blooms because they don't devote energy to their root systems. However, their ability to come back after a 
 dormant period is likely to be poor. They're treated as annuals and tossed out after one blooming season. 
 Each flower lasts about a week, with continuous blooming time lasting several weeks. Pinching off spent flowers will prolong the blooming season. 
  
  
 After-Flowering Care 
  
 Overwinter tuber-grown gloxinias 
 . 
 Plants grown from tubers can be stored in a cool, dry place for the winter and made to 
 bloom the following year. 
 After flowering, 
  
 water lightly until the leaves die down. Then, allow the soil to dry out and overwinter 
 the tuber in its pot. Keep it cool (about 50°F/10°C) during this dormancy. 
 Repot tubers in spring 
 .  
 To make the plant bloom again, pot the tuber hollow side up on the surface of fresh soil. 
 Moisten the soil every few weeks. When you see new growth, place the pot in bright, indirect light and begin watering and fertilizing regularly. 
  
 Buying tip: 
 Choose a plant with buds that are just beginning to open. You'll enjoy a succession 
 of blossoms that will last for several weeks. 
 Seed-raised varieties include 'Glory', a compact plant, and 'Brocade' with double flowers. 
  
 Gloxinia Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 White halos on leaves 
  are caused by cold water. Always use room-temperature water for watering houseplants. 
 Dropped buds? 
 Dry air and hot or cold drafts may cause flower buds to drop off before they open. 
 Keep your plants away from entry ways and heat/AC vents. 
 Gloxinias are native to South American 
 rainforests, where the relative humidity stays well above 70%. Short of turning your home into a misty rainforest, there are 
 a few things you can do to 
 raise the humidity 
 for your plant. 
 Something bugging your gloxinia? 
   
 Spider mites 
  are attracted to warm, dry conditions and may invade houseplants. Look for webbing between stems and foliage or dry-looking, yellow-speckled leaves as signs of an infestation. If your plant is seriously infested, get rid of it -- treatments with an insecticidal soap typically destroys the flowers. Wet, peaty potting mixes may attract  
 fungus gnats 
  -- these are easier to get rid of. Look for tiny, black insects crawling on the surface of the potting medium. 
 Yellow leaves 
  may be caused by over-watering or too much direct sunlight. Older leaves will turn yellow then brown as the plant enters dormancy, this is normal. 
 Are Gloxinias poisonous? 
  No. 
 Sinningia 
  hybrids are in the Gesneriaceae family, along with African violets and are non-toxic. You can keep them indoors with peace of mind, knowing they are safe around children, cats and dogs. 
  
 Gloxinia Growing Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
 8 in (20 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light; no direct sun. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist. Provide good drainage or the roots may rot. 
 Avoid getting the velvety leaves of this plant wet. Water will cause brown spots on the leaves and they won't come off. 
 If the leaves need to be cleaned, brush them gently with a soft, dry brush, such as a small paintbrush. 
 Remember to always use room-temperature water when watering your indoor plants. 
 Humidity: 
 This Brazilian rain forest native likes humid air. Try to maintain at least 50% relative humidity around your gloxinias. (Your other tropicals will love this, too!) Set plant on a tray of wet pebbles or use a cool-mist room humidifier. Do not mist because misting may cause spots or fungus the 
 flowers and leaves. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C 
 Soil: 
 African violet potting mix has a light peaty mix with added perlite that is ideal for this flowering houseplant. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks while the plant is growing and blooming with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer. Don't use a balanced fertilizer, because too much nitrogen can cause the leaves to become twisted or curled. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds; leaf cuttings; division of tubers.

 Grow Musella Lasiocarpa Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Musella lasiocarpa 
  
 Want a unique house plant? If you have a sunny spot for it, grow a Golden Lotus Banana indoors. 
  
  
  
  
 Its pseudostems are formed from overlapping leaf sheaths. Healthy plants readily produce offsets, which can 
 be divided and potted up. This generous plant just keeps on giving! 
 Purely ornamental, this relative of the banana plant won't grow edible fruit. But mature plants 
 (at least 2-3 years old) make an unexpected accent 
 for your sunroom with big, colorful flowers and handsome leaves. 
 Sometimes called the Golden Lotus Banana, its bloom resembles a lotus flower. You can expect those 
 golden blooms to last several months. 
  
 Caring for Musella Lasiocarpa Year-Round 
  
 Repot in spring 
  when necessary. Put it in a large container and give it plenty of room to grow -- 
 its wide leaves fan out. And it's a good idea to use a heavy pot to prevent toppling. It can get top-heavy. 
 Prune your plant. 
  Prune off damaged leaves, using sharp pruners. 
 The leaves split easily, and over time can look ragged. Be selective in what you cut -- 
 you don't want a stem with few leaves. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  These Chinese flowering bananas are virtually pest-free. Watch for the webbing of 
 spider mites 
 that may attack indoor plants in the winter months. They're so tiny, you'll first notice their fine webbing between the leaves. Treat any infestation immediately and keep any affected plant isolated. 
 Raising the humidity near the plant will help to prevent an infestation. 
 Golden Lotus Banana is difficult to find at garden centers unless you live in a warm climate.  
 Your best bet is online nurseries. 
  
 Musella Lasiocarpa Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  China 
 Height: 
 Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun year-round. 
 If your golden lotus banana plant doesn't bloom, it's not getting enough sun. Give it at 
 least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day in spring and summer. 
 You can move your plant outdoors for the summer, just be sure 
 to bring it inside when the temperature drops to 50°F/10°C at night. 
 Water: 
 All bananas are heavy drinkers and this Chinese relative is no exception. Keep 
 the soil evenly moist in spring and summer, slightly drier in winter. If the leaves fold downward from 
 the center rib and turn brown, the plant is thirsty. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim for 40% relative humidity or higher around the plant. It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor rather than guess whether the air is dry. Homes can become extremely dry during the winter months. The most efficient way to raise the humidity around indoor plants is to use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C). Musella lasiocarpa will tolerate temps 
 down to 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
 Any good potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Fertilize regularly. Your plant won't grow and flower without a steady supply of nutrients. F 
 eed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Musella lasiocarpa produces offsets, called "pups" throughout the year. Pups can be divided in 
 late spring or summer. To detach, dig down to carefully separate its roots and pot it up separately. Be patient -- it takes about 
 2-3 years after planting an offset for it to flower.

 Golden Shrimp Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pachystachys lutea 
  
 Golden shrimp plant is an evergreen shrub with branching, woody 
 stems. Long, dark-green leaves grow in pairs opposite one another and are deeply veined.

 The real attraction is the plant's magnificent flower spikes, featuring bright golden bracts that grow to 4 in (10 cm) long 
 and last from spring through the end of summer. 
 These long-lasting, upright bracts give this plant its other common name, 
 Lollipop Plant 
 . (I don't really see a resemblance, do you?) 
 Long, white flowers emerge from the flower bracts, opening in succession from the bottom of the bract to the top. 
  
 Did You Know... 
  
 Golden Shrimp Plant is in the Acanthaceae family, along with the other shrimp plant,  
 Justicia brandegeana 
 . 
 The two plants look similar, the biggest differences are that the  
 Pachystachys 
 has 
 bigger leaves and its flower spikes are held upright, rather than arching to one side. 
  
  
 Caring for Golden Shrimp Plant Year-Round 
  
 Prune it back. 
 Golden shrimp plant is a perennial shrub that will last for several years. 
  
 It'll get tall and leggy if not 
 pruned back regularly. 
 Prune it back hard to control 
 this plant's growth -- by half when necessary -- 
 when the plant starts new growth in spring. 
 Pinch your plant. 
  Pinch off the growing tips often to encourage branching. You'll 
 be rewarded with a much nicer-looking plant that is compact and bushy. If you want, 
 you can propagate the stem tip cuttings for more plants. 
 Repot in spring 
  when roots show through the bottom of the pot. You can keep potting up -- into a larger pot each year and allow it to grow into a shrub. But as I mentioned before, this plant will drop its old leaves and become leggy if you don't prune it back. 
  
 Golden Shrimp Plant Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
 Up to 3 ft (90 cm) if not pruned back. 
 Light: 
  
 Give it bright light, but keep it shaded from hot, direct sun. If your shrimp plant doesn't bloom much, it's not getting enough light. Move it to a brighter location, such as a West-facing window. You can put it outside for the summer, if you want. Just keep it shaded outdoors. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall, slightly drier in winter. Its leaves 
 may fall off if the soil dries out. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain relative humidity of 40-50% or higher. If indoor air is dry, use one of these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C; minimum winter temperature 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
 Any good-quality potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through early fall with a high-phosphorous water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Cuttings root easily. Take 4 in (10 cm) soft stem tip cuttings in early summer. Dip the cut ends in  
 rooting powder 
 , then insert them in fresh potting mix.

 Golden Trumpet Vine 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Allamanda cathartica 
  
 Golden trumpet boasts big, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers all summer and throughout fall. 
  
  
  
 Give this Brazilian native warmth, humidity and plenty of light to thrive. A sunny window, greenhouse or sunroom 
 is ideal. You can scoot your container to your sunlit porch or patio for the summer, if you want.

 Pasya Firmansyah 
  
 This tropical evergreen has vining stems densely covered with glossy, dark-green oval leaves. Scrolled flower buds 
 emerge in summer at the tips of stems and open up to yellow trumpet flowers that can grow to 4 in (10 cm) wide. 
 Train your plant. 
 Provide a trellis to support its vigorous, climbing stems and to show off 
 those glorious golden flowers. 
 The stems are more flexible than they seem and 
 are easy to weave through a  
 trellis 
 . 
 Use soft plant ties to hold each vine in place. 
 Tie them loosely so that you don't restrict growth, and re-tie vines as they grow. 
  
 Caring for Golden Trumpet Vine 
  
  
 Let the sun shine in. 
 Put your plant in a sunroom or by a sunny window. Moving your Allamanda plant outdoors 
 for the summer will give it more blooming power. A semi-sunny spot is ideal. Just be sure to bring it back 
 inside before the temperature drops to 60°F/16°C at night. 
 Repot in spring. 
 This is one of the few flowering plants that grows well in a large container. Move 
 it up 1 pot size every spring as necessary. Don't over-pot -- a common mistake with potted plants. Why? A container that's too big will hold too much water. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil which can lead to root rot. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
 Allamanda is tropical, not hardy so keep it at room temperature. Although it's evergreen, 
 growth will slow down over the winter. Stop fertilizing and water sparingly in winter, but never allow the soil to dry out completely. 
  
 Prune it back. 
 Golden trumpet vine looks spectacular when allowed to grow. However, if you want to control its size, 
 prune it back in early spring -- by half when necessary. 
 Golden trumpet flowers at the tips of new branches, so you'll get more 
 blooms this way. 
 Cut off spent blooms 
 to encourage more flowers. 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 Older leaves turn yellow and fall off. This is normal. 
 Prune back bare stems by half to encourage new growth and more flower buds. Use sharp pruners to cut just above a leaf axil. 
  
  
 Something bugging your plant? 
 Watch for 
 mealybugs 
 and 
 aphids 
  
 and treat any infestation immediately. 
 Is Golden Trumpet Vine poisonous? 
 Yes. The milky sap of this plant contains a strong toxin, which may cause severe skin irritation. It's a good idea to 
 wear gloves when handling it. 
  
 Golden Trumpet Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
 Up to 8 ft (2.4 m) if not pruned back. A dwarf variety reaches about 15 in (38 cm). 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. Give it  
 at least 
 4 hours of direct sunlight each day. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, then allow the top 2 inches (5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Empty drainage tray to prevent soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (50% relative humidity or higher). Use a  
 humidity tray 
  
 or a cool-mist room humidifier to raise the moisture in the air around it. It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor, rather than guess. Indoor air can become extremely dry during the winter months. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C. Allamanda plant is 
 frost-tender. Actually, it doesn't like the cold at all. It will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C in winter. Protect your plant from cold blasts from doorways, as well as heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 Any good-quality potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3-4 in (8-10 cm) stem tip cuttings in early spring and root them in moist soil. Propagating 
 the cuttings requires a  
 heat mat 
 for best results.

 Goldfish Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Columnea gloriosa 
  and hybrids 
  
  
  
 Goldfish plant gets its common name from the long, tubular orange or orange-red flowers that look like everyone's first pet -- goldfish. 
 This is a perennial and will last for several years with good care. Long stems can reach up to 3 ft (90 cm) and 
 are densely covered with thick, waxy, dark-green leaves. 
  
 This eye-catching tropical houseplant is just plain fun to have around. 
  
 Many named hybrids are available, offering a colorful variety of leaves and flowers. 
 'Firebird' 
 and 
 'Aladdin's Lamp' 
 have red flowers and dark-green leaves. 
 Yellow blooms edged in red make 
 'California Gold' 
 a stunning house plant. 
 'Chanticleer' 
 is a prolific bloomer with a compact growing habit. 
 Put this exotic trailing plant in a hanging basket or on a pedestal table 
 to show off its spectacular foliage and blooms.

 Year-Round Care for Your Goldfish Plant 
  
 Get the most blooms. 
  You can expect dozens of blooms on mature plants in spring and summer. Some plants 
 may also bloom at other times during the year. You'll get the most blooms by providing plenty of bright, indirect light. Keep 
 the soil slightly dry in the winter to help promote heavy flowering in spring. Just be careful not to allow the 
 soil to dry out completely. 
 Pinch your plant. 
  Pinch off the growing tips often to encourage branching. You'll 
 be rewarded with a much nicer-looking plant that is compact and bushy. It's a good idea to keep the stems 
 at 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) to prevent it from getting leggy. If you want, 
 you can propagate the stem tip cuttings for more plants. 
 To repot...or not? 
  This one likes to be slightly root-bound, and blooms best this way. Repot in spring 
 when it has outgrown its pot.  
 Columnea 
  likes loose potting medium, so don't pack it down. Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. If you want to use a decorative planter without drainage holes, use it as a cachepot. Just slip a plain nursery pot inside the cachepot. I put pebbles in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above any drainage water. 
 Dropped leaves? 
  This tropical native doesn't like the cold at all, which can cause leaf drop. Also keep up the humidity around it -- dry air can cause leaves to fall off. 
 Brown leaves? 
  Don't put this tropical native outdoors for the summer. 
 Keep it indoors year-round. Goldfish plants don't like high heat or direct sunlight, 
 which can cause its leaves to turn brown. 
  
  
  
 Goldfish Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Central and South America 
 Height: 
 Stems may grow up to 3 ft (90 cm) long if not pinched back. 
 Light: 
 Goldfish plant needs plenty of bright, indirect light to bloom. Keep out of direct sunlight, which will turn leaves brown. 
 Water: 
 Spring through fall, water thoroughly and allow the top 2 inches (5 cm) to dry out between waterings. 
 Water less often in winter, but don't dry it out completely. Always use tepid water to water your indoor plants, because cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high (50% relative humidity or higher). Use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  or a humidity tray to maintain moist air. Or mist 
 foliage every day -- use room-temperature water because cold water will cause brown spots on the foliage. It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor near your plant rather than guess; indoor air can become extremely dry, especially in the winter. 
 Temperature: 
 Warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. Goldfish plant will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C in winter. Exposure to cold will cause its leaves to fall off. Don't expose the plant to cold drafts from windows, doors or AC vents. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a high-phosphorus liquid or water-soluble fertilizer (such as 15-30-15) diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings (without flowers) in spring or summer. For best results, dip cut end in  
 rooting hormone powder 
 , then insert in lightly moist potting mix. Keep consistently warm (70°F/21°C) using a seedling heat mat.

 Grape Hyacinths 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Muscari 
  spp. 
 Grape hyacinths are in the same family as hyacinths (Liliaceae), however, they belong to the Muscari genus. 
  
  
  
  
 Each hyacinth bulb produces a thick, upright flower stem, which carries a cluster of rounded flowers that resembles a bunch of grapes. 
 Grape hyacinth flowers are lightly fragrant and available in beautiful shades of lavender-blue to purple, plus pink and 
 white varieties, too. 
 Surrounding the flower stems are narrow, arching leaves. 
  
 Naturally spring-flowering, grape hyacinths are easy to force into bloom mid-winter. The process is called forcing 
 because the bulbs are tricked into behaving as if they've gone through a cold winter, then brought into warmth and sunshine 
 as if it's spring. Flowers last about a month when forced indoors and kept at a cool temperature. 
 Grape hyacinth bulbs need a cold treatment for 10 weeks to bloom. 
 You can begin the cold process anytime in fall. 
 October is a good time to start for mid-winter blooms. If you have 
 a lot of bulbs, you can plant just a few at a time, keeping the bulbs cold until you're ready to force them. This way, 
 you'll have pots (or vases) in bloom throughout the winter and early spring. 
  
 Forcing Grape Hyacinth Bulbs - Step by Step 
  
  
 Choose a pot (at least 3 in/7 cm deep) with drainage holes in the bottom. Fill the pot loosely with potting mix. Set bulbs side by side -- close but not touching -- pointed end up. Set bulbs so that their tips are even with pot rim. Do not press the bulbs into the mix. It should be loose so the roots can grow through it easily. Cover with additional potting mix, leaving the tips exposed. 
 Water thoroughly and discard drainage. 
 Move pot to a dark, cool, but not freezing, (40°F/4°C) location such as a basement, unheated garage or refrigerator. Avoid storing bulbs near ripening fruit or vegetables which give off ethylene gas which can damage the bulbs. Keep them in cold storage for about 10 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist. 
 When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, bring the pot out of cold storage and place it in a slightly warmer (50°F/10°C) location with low light intensity. Increase watering, keeping the soil evenly moist. Over the next few days, gradually move it toward a sunny window. Turn the pot every day for even growth. When in full bloom, keep your grape hyacinth plant in a bright location out of direct sun to prolong the bloom. 
  
 Buying Grape Hyacinth Bulbs 
  
  
 You'll find hyacinth bulbs for sale in fall at garden centers and online flower bulb nurseries. 
 Muscari armeniacum 
 'Blue Spike' grape hyacinth is ideal for forcing indoors. 
 Deep-blue 'Dark Eyes', double-flowered 'Fantasy Creation' and snowy white 'Album' are also good choices. 
 Can't decide? You can buy an assortment of mixed colors. 
  
 Grape Hyacinths Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Western Asia 
 Height: 
 4-8 in (10-20 cm) 
 Light: 
 Keep bulbs in a dark location during cold treatment. Cover pot with a box, pot or black garbage bag if necessary. 
 After shoots appear, move to bright light as directed above. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy which can cause the bulbs to rot. Allow the surface of the potting mix to dry before watering. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity) 
 Temperature: 
 Cool 40-65°F/4-18°C . 
 Make your flowers last longer by keeping the plant in a slightly cooler location. Blooms will last for about a month 
 if kept at a maximum of 65°F/18°C. 
 Soil: 
 All-purpose good-quality potting mix. Hyacinths can also be grown in a bulb vase with its roots in water. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Not necessary 
 Propagation: 
 Grape hyacinths that are forced into bloom indoors will not bloom a second time. 
 They do produce offsets, which can be planted outdoors. If you want to keep the bulbs, allow the foliage to die back naturally, then cut 
 it off. Store the bulbs in a cool, dry place for the summer, then plant them in your flower garden in the fall.

 Heliconia Psittacorum 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Heliconia psittacorum 
  
  
  
  
 Add a touch of the tropics to any sun-splashed room with this Brazilian beauty. 
 Its huge, deeply veined green leaves grow on narrow vertical stalks. Its blooms are spectacular. 
 Carried on tall, upright stems, bright orange and red bracts have yellow-to-orange flowers, often tipped with dark green.  
 Those exotic flowers remind me of  
 Strelitzia reginae 
  -- the bird-of-paradise plant. However,  
 Heliconia 
  is easier to please indoors. And you won't wait long for those magnificent flowers -- 
 H. psittacorum 
  blooms nearly year-round, beginning its first year. 
  
 Heliconia psittacorum is a relative of the banana. Can you see the resemblance? 
  
 Caring for Heliconia Plant Indoors 
  
 Shed some light. 
  
 You can expect an abundance of exotic flowers throughout spring and summer -- maybe even fall. If your  
 Heliconia psittacorum 
  plant doesn't bloom much, it's not 
 getting enough light. Move it to a sunny window or sunroom... or scoot it outdoors when the weather is warm. It'll be fine as long 
 as the temperature doesn't dip below 55°F/13°C. 
 Deadhead flowers. 
  Cut off spent flower stems to encourage more blooms; cut them off at soil level. 
 Repot in spring 
  every 2-3 years or when your plant outgrows its pot. Use a large, heavy container to prevent toppling 
 -- this plant can get top-heavy. This is a good time to divide the plant, if you want. 
 Boost the humidity. 
 Dry indoor air may cause dry, brown spots on leaves. I 
 f your home is dry in winter, u 
 se a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
 Watch for  
 scale insects 
  on the undersides of leaves, usually along the central rib. Scale insects suck plant juices, causing curled, deformed leaves. Raising the humidity around your plant in winter helps to prevent 
 spider mites 
  
 that love dry conditions. Look for their webbing between stems and leaves, a tell-tale sign of an invasion. Treat any pest infestation right away because these tiny critters cause damage and will likely move on to your other houseplants. 
  
 Heliconia Psittacorum Varieties 
  
 Many cultivars are available to choose from. 
 'Lady Di' 
 is a long-time favorite with dramatic red bracts and creamy yellow flowers. 
 Orange-red bracts with orange flowers make 
 'Andromeda' 
 a popular selection. 
 'Choconiana' 
 is a dependable bloomer with orange-red bracts and orange flowers. 
 Variegated foliage and yellow-and-red bracts make 
 'Parakeet' 
 an exciting new cultivar.  
 'Fuchsia' 
  has large, pink bracts and creamy yellow flowers. 
 When buying a plant, look for the botanical name  
 Heliconia psittacorum 
  to be sure you're getting this plant. Many  
 Heliconia 
  species get quite large for indoor growing. 
  
 Given enough sunlight, this tropical plant blooms most of the year. 
  
 Heliconia Psittacorum Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  3-4 ft (.9-1.2 m) tall indoors; dwarf varieties are less than 2 ft (.6 m) tall 
 Light: 
  Bright light to direct sun. 
 Your  
 Heliconia psittacorum 
  will bloom most of the year when it gets plenty of light. 
 You can move it to your porch or patio in summer to give it the sunlight it needs. Remember, it may be thirstier if 
 it's kept outdoors. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall. Keep soil slightly drier in winter, when growth has slowed -- but don't allow it to dry out.  
 Heliconia 
  doesn't like soggy potting medium, either. 
 Young plants, especially, are prone to root rot if kept too wet. 
 I highly recommend using a moisture meter rather than guess how much water is in the planter. Older  
 Heliconias 
  are more drought-tolerant. 
 Humidity: 
 This South American native likes humid air. Aim to maintain 50-60% relative humidity around the plant. Indoor air can get extremely dry in winter and need a boost. I've found that a  
 cool-mist portable humidifier 
  is the easiest and most efficient way to raise humidity around tropical houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. Don't expose  
 Heliconia psittacorum 
  to temps below 55°F/13°C. It's tropical, not hardy. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite to improve drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly during the growing season (spring through fall) with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. Do not 
 feed in winter when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
  Divide rhizomes in spring and pot separately. Don't bury them -- set rhizomes just below the soil. Any growth on the rhizome should remain above the soil level. Keep the potting medium lightly moist; over-watering will cause rhizomes to rot.

 White Hellebore Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Helleborus niger 
 White hellebore is a winter bloomer that has emerged as a popular house plant for the  
 holiday season. Often called Christmas Rose, flowers bloom from winter through spring. 
  
  
  
 Display this pristine, white alpine beauty where all will admire it. Image by  
 tousaujardin 
  
 This hellebore plant is sold by florists already in bloom before the holidays, which makes it a festive decoration. 
 However, you'll likely see this Christmas Rose flower later in the season in subsequent years -- probably between January and April. 
 Flowers are held singly on upright, thick stems and open flat. Some new hybrids have a starry shape, while many 
 have rounded petals. Thick, shiny evergreen leaves make this plant attractive year-round. 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 While it's tempting to put a flowering plant in a bright, sunny window, remember that this one prefers lower light levels. Place this white Alpine beauty in a cool, shaded window. 
  
  
 Native to mountain regions of Europe, this evergreen thrives with cool temps and low light levels. If you live in 
 U.S. Zone 4, you can move your potted plant outdoors after blooming is over. Plant it in your shade garden with well-drained 
 soil and you'll enjoy this perennial for many years. 
  
 Hellebores have brittle roots and don't like to be moved around. If you move it outdoors, find a spot in your shade garden or near a pathway where you'll see its enchanting flowers while the rest of the garden is still asleep. 
  
  
 To repot...or not. 
 Repot white hellebore when you see roots at the soil surface or coming out the drainage holes. 
 Wait till spring to repot -- never while it's blooming. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. You can cover a plain nursery pot by dropping it into a  
 cachepot 
  -- a decorative container without drainage holes. 
 Is  
 Hellebore niger 
 poisonous? Oh, yes. 
 Keep your indoor plant away from young children and pets. You'll also want 
 to wear gloves when handling it because this beautiful bloomer may cause skin irritation. The good news is that if you plant 
 it outdoors, deer won't touch it.

 White Hellebore Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mountainous regions of Europe, including Switzerland, southern Germany, Austria and northern Italy. 
 Height: 
  Up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Put your potted hellebore plant where it will get partial or filtered sunlight. Indirect morning sun 
 and afternoon shade will suit it fine. 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil evenly moist while hellebore is growing and flowering. 
 Water less after flowering is finished. Yellow leaves are caused by overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
  Will tolerate average room (around 40% relative humidity). Homes can become extremely dry in winter; use a small  
 cool-mist humidifier 
 if needed. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool to average 45-65°F/7-18°C 
 Soil: 
  Neutral (pH 7) to alkaline (up to pH 9) potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly year-round with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Divide plants in early spring, shortly after flowering is over. Handle its fragile roots with care.

 Growing Hibiscus Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Hibiscus rosa sinensis 
 hybrids 
 Growing hibiscus indoors allows you to show off these bright, tropical flowers in your home 
 from spring to fall. 
  
  
  
  
 This evergreen hibiscus shrub has upright branches densely covered with glossy, dark-green ovate leaves. 
 Giant hibiscus flowers can grow 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) across, with ruffled, trumpet-shaped blooms in red, 
 white, pink, yellow, peach, orange and purple. Flowers may be single, semi-double or double, depending on the variety. You can 
 expect bloom life to be about 2-3 days, with a succession of blooms that last for months. 
  
 Caring for Hibiscus Year-Round 
  
 Caring for hibiscus plants is fairly easy if you keep a few things in mind. 
 Let the sun shine in. 
 Flowering plants need plenty of light to bloom. And this tropical beauty needs more than 
 most. Keep it where it'll get a few hours of direct sun every day. If you put hibiscus outside for the summer, 
 find a spot for it in a mostly sunny area and leave it there. Changes in light can cause it to drop its flower buds.

 . 
 Keep it warm. 
 Hibiscus plants need warmth. That's not difficult to provide in a home. A sunny window will 
 give it the light and warmth it needs to thrive. 
 Pinch and prune. 
 Unless you want a huge shrub in your home, pruning hibiscus is necessary. To control its size, 
 prune it back in spring -- by half when necessary. Pinch growing tips to help it branch out. Hibiscus grows flower 
 buds at the end of new branches, so you'll get more blooms this way. 
 Give it a rest. 
 Keep your hibiscus cool in winter (about 60°F/16°C) and allow soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Repot in spring 
 , using a pot just 1-2 inches (2.5 - 5 cm) larger. You can cut off about 1/3 of its roots before repotting to help keep the plant small. If it's already the size you want, top-dress every year by replacing the top 1-2 inches of soil. 
 Growing hibiscus indoors is a little work, but worth it. You'll be rewarded with big, gorgeous flowers in vibrant colors. 
 With good care, you'll enjoy your flowering plant for many years. 
  
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 You can buy hibiscus in the spring and summer, the heaviest bloom time. Choose one with plenty of flower buds -- a 
 sign of a healthy plant. 
 Hundreds of cultivars offer endless varieties to choose from. Pick the color you like. 
  
 Tips for Growing Hibiscus Indoors 
  
  
 Origin: 
 China 
 Height: 
 6 ft (1.8 m) or more if not pruned back. 
 Light: 
 Bright light with some direct sunlight. Plants that don't get enough light will grow tall and leggy, 
 with few blooms. 
 Growing hibiscus in a sunny spot outdoors for the summer will give it more blooming power. 
 Just be sure to bring it back inside before the temperature drops to 50°F/10°C at night. 
 It's tropical, not cold-hardy. 
 Try to move your plant back inside gradually. Sudden changes in light can cause the leaves 
 to turn yellow and drop off. Raising the humidity around the plant can help. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly and allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Put it in a pot with 
 drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate. If relative humidity falls below 50%, mist the foliage and place the pot 
 on a tray of wet pebbles. Discover easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-85°F/18-29°C during the growing season; 60°F/16°C in winter. 
 Soil: 
 Use a fast-draining potting mix. You can use an all-purpose mix and add a couple handfuls of perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a water-soluble fertilizer specially made for hibiscus 
 (at half the recommended strength) while plant is 
 growing and flowering. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. Growing hibiscus from cuttings can 
 take several weeks.

 Forcing Hyacinth Flower Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Hyacinthus orientalis 
  hybrids 
 You can find hyacinth flower in florist's shops in the middle of winter. It's more enjoyable, though, to force the 
 bulbs yourself and watch them grow. And it's so easy to do. 
  
  
  
 Bring on spring by forcing fragrant hyacinths indoors mid-winter. 
  
 Each bulb produces a thick flower stem, which carries dozens of small, waxy flowers. The hyacinth flower is highly fragrant and comes 
 in stunning shades of blue, violet-blue, red, orange, pink, yellow or white. Surrounding the flower stems are narrow, upright leaves. 
  
 Forcing hyacinth in vase 
  
 Naturally spring-flowering, hyacinth flower bulbs are easy to force into bloom mid-winter. The process is called forcing 
 because the bulbs are tricked into behaving as if they've gone through a cold winter, then brought into warmth and sunshine 
 as if it's spring. 
 Hyacinth bulbs need a cold treatment for 12 weeks to bloom. 
 If you bought pre-chilled bulbs, you can skip this step. 
 You can begin the cold process anytime in fall. October is a good time to start for mid-winter blooms. If you have 
 a lot of bulbs, you can plant just a few at a time, keeping the bulbs cold until you're ready to force them. This way, 
 you'll have pots (or vases) in bloom throughout the winter and early spring.

 Forcing Hyacinth Bulbs - Step by Step 
  
 Choose a shallow pot (at least 3 in/7 cm deep) with drainage holes in the bottom. Fill the pot loosely with potting mix. Set bulbs side by side -- close but not touching -- pointed end up. Set bulbs so that their tips are even with pot rim. Do not press the bulbs into the mix. It should be loose so the roots can grow through it easily. Cover with additional potting mix, leaving the tips exposed. 
 Water thoroughly and discard drainage. 
 Move pot to a dark, cool, but not freezing, (40°F/4°C) location such as a basement, unheated garage or refrigerator. Avoid storing bulbs near ripening fruit or vegetables which give off ethylene gas that can damage the bulbs. Keep them in cold storage for about 12 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist. 
 When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, bring the pot out of cold storage and place it in a slightly warmer (50°F/10°C) location with low light intensity. Increase watering, keeping the soil evenly moist. Over the next few days, gradually move it toward a sunny window. Turn the pot every day for even growth. When in full bloom, keep hyacinth flower in a bright location out of direct sun to prolong the bloom.

 Want to grow hyacinth bulbs in vases instead? 
  
 Hourglass-shaped hyacinth vases 
 will hold the bulb in place while it's growing. 
 Keep the bottom of the vase filled with water, but don't allow the bulb to sit in water because it will rot. 
 Remember, it still needs chilling as described above. Keep the bulbs in a paper sack during the cold treatment. When 
 you see them sprouting, bring the bulbs out and place them in the vases.  
 Set vases in a bright, yet cool location. 
  
 Buying Hyacinth Bulbs 
  
 You'll find hyacinth bulbs for sale in fall. Different varieties have different bloom times, so it's a good idea 
 to plant the same variety in each pot, rather than to mix them. 
 'Woodstock' hyacinth hybrids are ideal for forcing indoors. Other popular cultivars include 
 'Delft Blue', soft-orange 'Gypsy Queen', snowy white 'Carnegie', buttery yellow 'City of Haarlem' and 'Pink Pearl'. 
  
 Hyacinth Flower Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Turkey 
 Height: 
 8-12 in (20-30 cm). Hyacinth flower heads can get heavy and may need staking. 
 Light: 
 Keep bulbs in a dark location during cold treatment. Cover pot with a box, pot or black garbage bag if necessary. 
 After shoots appear, gradually move to bright light as directed above. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy which can cause the bulbs to rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity) or higher. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool 45-65°F/7-18°C . 
 Make your flowers last longer by keeping them in a slightly cooler location. Blooms will last for 2-3 
 weeks if kept at a maximum of 65°F/18°C. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. Hyacinths can also be grown in a bulb vase of water, as directed above. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Not necessary 
 Propagation: 
 Hyacinth bulbs that are forced into bloom indoors will not bloom a second time. 
 They do produce offsets, which can be planted outdoors. If you want to keep them, allow the foliage to die back naturally, then cut 
 it back. Store the offset bulbs in a cool, dry place. Plant the bulbs in your flower garden in the fall.

 Indoor Hydrangea Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Hydrangea macrophylla 
  
 Good hydrangea care includes cool air, bright light and moist soil. 
 Dozens of species exist. The best for growing indoors is 
 Hydrangea macrophylla 
 -- the mophead hydrangea, which offers hundreds of varieties. 
  
  
  
 Image by  
 Peggy und Marco Lachmann-Anke 
  
 Put a potted hydrangea on a dining table, in a sunroom or anywhere you want to add instant garden ambiance. 
 This is a plant that really knows how to show off. Big, round clusters of small flowers cover mophead hydrangeas all summer 
 in blue, violet-blue, white, pink or red. New cultivars are introduced with bi-colored blooms, and in more vibrant colors than we've ever seen. 
 Hydrangea 
 'Endless Summer' 
 produces an abundance of pale-blue blooms. It's one of the hardiest -- good to know if you live 
 in a cold climate and plan to move your plant outdoors. 
 More popular varieties include violet-blue 
 'Nikko Blue' 
 , deep-blue 
 'All Summer Beauty' 
 and snowy white 
 'Libelle' 
 . 
  
 Hydrangea Care and Maintenance 
  
  
 Keep the soil moist. 
 Dry soil can be the death of this plant. Leaves that turn yellow and fall off are a sign 
 of dry soil. Flowering plants are thirsty, so it's a good idea to check the soil every day while in bloom. 
 Hydrangea pruning. 
  
 Mophead hydrangeas don't need to be pruned back unless you want to control their size. 
 Cutting off about 1/3 of the oldest stems will give you a fuller plant. When to prune hydrangeas: After blossoms fade. 
 Hydrangea shrubs are perennials. Woody stems are densely covered with big, oval leaves that are deep green. 
  
 Pruning hydrangea care tip: 
 When pruning hydrangea, care should be taken not 
 to tear the stems, which can damage the plant. Use clean, sharp  pruners 
 to cut the stem at a 45° angle, 1/4-inch after a leaf axle. 
  
  
 Overwintering your plant. 
 Hydrangea shrubs are perennials. If you intend to keep your plant, repot after flowering is over and cut the woody stems back by half. Water sparingly in winter. 
 Keep the plant cool during the winter, then move it to warmer conditions in late winter to help bring it into bloom. 
 If you meet the needs for hydrangea care, you can count on it to bloom year after year. 
  
  
 How to keep blue flowers blue. 
 Blue hydrangeas need acidic soil (pH 5.5 and lower) or they will change flower color 
 from blue to pink. Alkaline soils (higher than pH 7) are fine for pink varieties. To keep the blue color, add 
 sulphur while the 
 plant is blooming. Neutral pH (between pH 5.5 and pH 7) can make the flowers purple or a mix of pink and blue. 
 It's important to know that not all cultivars can change to blue, so buy the color you want and try to maintain it. It's much easier to maintain a color than to change it completely by experimenting with soil acidity. Besides, some varieties won't change no matter what you do. 
  
  
  
 Preserve Your Mophead Hydrangeas 
  
 Drying Hydrangeas. 
  
 Hydrangea color will be best preserved by allowing the flower stem to dry on the plant. 
 Cut them off when the flowers have a papery feel, with a stem length suitable for a vase, centerpiece, or whatever flower arrangement 
 you choose. 
  
  
 Strip off all leaves, and then find a dark, dry room where the flowers can finish drying. Hang the stems upside down 
 while drying to prevent them from bending. Keep the flower stems separate as they dry so that none of the flowers get squashed. 
 Mopheads are among the most beautiful dried hydrangeas, turning soft shades of blue, green, violet and rose. 
  
 Hydrangea Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Japan 
 Height: 
  2 ft (60 cm) indoors 
 Light: 
  Provide at least 4 hours of bright, indirect light every day. 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy while plant is growing and flowering. Pots are usually packed tightly with roots, so water often. Use lime-free water because 
 lime will make the soil alkaline. Water sparingly in winter, when hydrangea is resting. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40-50% relative humidity). If your indoor air is dry, use one of these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Keep your hydrangea plant as cool as possible to prolong the flowering time. Preferably below 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
  Peat-based lime-free soil for blue varieties. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced fertilizer (such as 10-10-10) diluted by half. Or, 
 use a slow-release fertilizer once in spring and again in summer. Go easy -- too much fertilizer may scorch its leaves. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 inch (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and root them in moist potting mix.

 Growing Impatiens Flowers 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Impatiens walleriana 
  hybrids 
 Growing impatiens flowers in containers allows you to enjoy a profusion of bright blooms just about anywhere. 
 Brighten up a kitchen windowsill, sunroom or patio with these constant-blooming flowers. 
  
  
  
  
 Impatiens flowers are typically flat, with 5 over-lapping petals and a prominent eye. You'll find them in a wide range of colors: 
 pink, red, salmon, lavender, white and bicolors. Some varieties have double flowers that look like mini roses. Soft, 
 oval leaves are held on succulent stems. 
 Impatiens are sometimes called Busy Lizzy, Patient Lucy and Touch-Me-Not. 
 Among the most popular flowers for shade, you'll find impatiens 
 for sale in garden centers in spring and summer. Many varieties are available. Look for the 
 Elfin and Dwarf varieties -- they're compact, making them attractive house plants. 
  
 Caring for Impatiens 
  
 Few flowers? 
 Impatiens won't bloom if they don't get enough light. When growing impatiens indoors, 
 it can be challenging to find a spot where they'll get at least 4 hours of bright, indirect sunlight each day. If you don't 
 have space near a sunny window, you can move your plant outdoors. Just keep it shaded from hot, direct sun in summer. 
 Water regularly. 
 Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy. Flowering plants are thirsty, and they dry out 
 quickly in containers, so check them often. 
 Check out the stylish  
 self-watering pots 
  
 available now. They not only cut back on your watering chores, these time-saving pots will prevent your impatiens from wilting. 
 Deadhead spent blooms. 
 Remove flowers as soon as they fade to keep plants looking their best and to encourage 
 more blooms. 
 Growing impatiens outdoors for the summer? 
 Bring the pots indoors when the temperature drops in fall and you'll enjoy their beauty just a while longer. 
 Before you bring them inside, check the plants for  
 spider mites 
 . 
 They may invade this plant if the humidity is low. 
 Repot plants. 
 You'll get the most blooms by keeping your impatiens slightly pot-bound, so move up to a bigger pot 
 only when the roots fill the pot. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which can cause root rot. 
  
 How to Care for Impatiens Flowers 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Asia, East Africa and New Guinea 
 Height: 
  Up to 15 in (38 cm); some dwarf varieties stay much smaller 
 Light: 
 Bright light; no direct midday sun in summer. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist, not soggy. 
 Impatiens flowers will quickly wilt if they are allowed to dry out. Use a pot with drainage holes and water thoroughly to ensure all the roots are watered. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate (at least 40% relative humidity). Place pot on a tray of wet pebbles to raise the humidity around it. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite for good drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer diluted by half. Too much 
 fertilizer promotes leafy growth and few flowers. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4 inch (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. They'll root easily in water or moist soil. Sow seeds 
 in spring or early summer.

 Ivy Geranium Flowers 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pelargonium peltatum 
  
 Ivy geranium has a graceful, trailing habit that makes it ideal for a hanging basket.

 This ivy leaf geranium sports clusters of alluring flowers, but the 5-lobed foliage that cover 
 its long, slender stems is showy in itself. 
 You can train the stems to climb, if you want. Climbing geraniums look 
 beautiful on a trellis inserted into the pot. 
  
 Ivy Geranium Varieties 
  
 New varieties offer a big selection. Ivy geranium colors may be white, pink, lavender, purple, orange, 
 salmon, red or burgundy. Traditionally single, 5-petaled flowers, many newer cultivars have semidouble or double blooms. 
 Some are bicolored and patterned. 
 You'll find geranium hanging basket plants for sale in spring and summer. 
 Look for 
 Pelargonium peltatum 
 to be sure you're getting this ivy leaf geranium. 
 'Galilee' 
 sports variegated leaves and rose-pink flowers. 
 'L'Elegante' 
 is a popular variety 
 with leaves edged in creamy white and a tinge of pink. 
 'Rouletta' 
 has red-and-white blooms. 
 'Mauve Beauty' 
 has double flowers that look like small rose blossoms.

 Caring for Ivy Geranium Year-Round 
  
 Pinch and prune. 
  Pinch off new stems regularly to encourage branching and to shape them as they grow. 
 Deadhead spent flowers to keep your plant looking neat and to promote more blooms. Pruning geraniums back hard in 
 spring will keep them compact. 
 Repot in spring. 
 Ivy geranium blooms best if slightly pot-bound. Move your plant to a pot 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger when you see roots growing through the drainage holes. Or 
 keep it in the same pot and just give it fresh potting mix. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
 Overwinter geraniums in a cool basement or garage with a minimum 
 temperature of 50°F/10°C. Water sparingly and stop fertilizing during this winter rest. 
  
 Ivy Geranium Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  Trailing to 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. 
 Give your ivy leaf geranium as much light as you can spring through fall. Move it outdoors for the 
 summer, if you like. Just bring it back inside when the temperature drops below 50°F/10°C. This is a tender 
 perennial that doesn't like the cold. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist, not soggy. Allow the top 1-inch (2.5 cm) of soil to dry between waterings. Cut back on watering 
 in winter, but don't allow the soil to dry out completely. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40-50% relative humidity). Use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  to increase moisture around the plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool nights (55-60°F/13-16°C) and warm days (65-75°F/18-24°C) will 
 trigger flower buds. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based soilless mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 3 weeks spring through fall with a high-phosphorus fertilizer diluted by half. 
 High-nitrogen fertilizers given to young plants will bring a lot of foliage growth, but few flowers. 
 To get the most blooms, use a high-phosphorus fertilizer only while the ivy geranium is budding and flowering. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem cuttings in spring and root in fresh potting mix. Geraniums are 
 easy to grow from seeds, too. Sow seeds in early spring.

 Ixora coccinea 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Ixora coccinea 
  
 Big, bright flower clusters give this beautiful tropical a couple common names: Flame-of-the-Woods and 
 Jungle Geranium. 
 Now you can find cultivars available with blooms in shades of pinks, oranges and reds. Each star-like flower 
 has 4 petals and can grow up to 1-in (2.5 cm) wide. Not that impressive, but put dozens of blooms together 
 and those flower heads pack a lot of sizzling color on this compact shrub. 
 Glossy, oval leaves grow in opposite pairs on upright stems. Prune 
 Ixora coccinea 
 back 
  after flowering is over, if you want 
 to keep it compact. Look for dwarf varieties -- ideal for growing in small containers. 
  
  
  
 Clusters of vibrant blooms make Ixora a sought-after tropical plant. 
  
 This magnificent Ixora shrub prefers sunshine, warm temps and high humidity, like in its native tropical habitat. 
 No blooms? 
 Ixoras that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. Put it in a warm greenhouse or sunroom to 
 give your plant what it wants. Depending on where you live, moving  
 Ixora coccinea 
  to your patio for the summer may be ideal. 
 Repot in spring 
 , moving up 1 pot size to give this beautiful flowering plant more room to grow. Use a pot 
 with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Overwinter Ixora indoors. 
  This perennial evergreen doesn't like the cold at all. If you set your potted shrub outside for the summer, bring it in when the temperature drops below 60°F/16°C at night. This sudden change to low light levels will be a shock to the plant and it will likely drop a lot of leaves. Don't worry, it's normal. Reduce watering and stop fertilizing till spring. 
  
 Ixora Coccinea Plant Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  India and Sri Lanka 
 Height: 
  Dwarf varieties grow up to 2 ft (30 cm). 
 Light: 
 Full sun to partial shade. 
 Ixora coccinea 
  needs plenty of direct sunlight to bloom. Scoot your plant outdoors for the summer, if you want, to give it the light it needs. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly then allow the surface of the potting medium to dry out before watering again. Don't allow it to dry out too much -- Ixora will wilt and not bloom well if the potting mix is dry. Use 
 rainwater, allowing it to warm up to room-temperature because cold water will shock this tropical native. Water 
 less in winter. 
 Humidity: 
 High humidity is a must. If relative humidity drops below 50%, place pot on a tray of 
 wet pebbles or use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  for Ixoras. If the leaf edges turn brown and flower buds shrivel without opening, the air is too dry. 
 Temperature: 
 Keep warm year-round (75°F/24°C) with a mininum temperature of 60°F/16°C. Protect plant from cold blasts from windows, entry ways and A/C vents. 
 Soil: 
 Acidic peat moss-based mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with an all-purpose water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3-inch (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. Dip the cut end in water, then 
 hormone rooting powder 
 . Put the stem in moist potting mix, then firm the mix around the 
 stem so that it stands up. Enclose the whole pot in plastic to maintain humidity. Roots should develop 
 in about a month.

 Chinese Jasmine Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Jasminum polyanthum 
  
 Chinese jasmine plant is surely among the most graceful of vining plants. Their 
 long, wiry vines are densely covered with 
 glossy, green leaves and fragrant star-shaped flowers. 
  
  
  
  
 How to Make Jasmine Plant Bloom 
  
 Cool autumn air and plenty of light will bring a profusion of blooms in winter. 
 Because you're growing jasmine 
 indoors, this beautiful evergreen needs some help from you. 
 Give it plenty of sunshine and warmth in the summer months to help it grow. 
 Then provide 6 weeks of 
 cool temperatures in fall to set buds. Move your jasmine plant outdoors in the fall when the weather is cool, 
 keeping it in partial shade. If you can't put it outdoors, keep it in a cool sunroom, brightly lit porch, 
 or other cool room for this cool treatment. 
  
  
 Clusters of dark-pink, tubular flower buds arise from the leaf axils in late fall to early winter. The buds 
 stay small until around February, when they will open into 5-petaled, white star-like flowers that are strongly scented, 
 especially at night. 
 Pinch and Prune 
 . Pinch stem tips during the growing season to encourage branching. After the flowers fade, prune it 
 back harshly. Plants that aren't pruned back will eventually have bare lower stems as they shed old leaves. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Prune back hard in spring or early summer 
 to control its growth and to prevent it from becoming leggy. Take care to only remove the stems that 
 have already flowered. Propagate stem tip cuttings, if you want, for more plants. 
  
  
  
 Repot in spring 
  only when the roots have filled the pot. Jasmine plant blooms best when slightly pot-bound, so 
 use a smallish container or you may see a lot of leaves and few flowers. 
 Don't worry about pruning and repotting jasmine at the same time. It's pretty robust -- you won't hurt it at all. 
 Support your plant 
 . Jasmine vines need support. You can easily train it around a hoop or over a small  
 trellis 
 inserted in the pot. 
 You can tie it to the support with florist wire, if you need to. However, this vigorous climber doesn't need much training 
 to twine around any type of support. 
  
 Jasmine Plant Buying Tips 
  
 Jasmine is a member of the olive family (Oleaceae), and includes about 200 species. 
 Jasminum polyanthum 
  is the easiest to grow indoors and has long been a popular 
 house plant. 
 You may find Chinese Jasmine plant for sale by other common names: Winter-Blooming Jasmine, Pink Jasmine 
 or Star Jasmine. 
  
  
 Jasmine Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  China 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) if not pruned back. 
 Light: 
 Jasmine needs plenty of light to bloom. Give it bright light with some direct sun. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist while plant is growing and flowering. After flowering, allow the 
 the soil to dry slightly between waterings. 
 Soggy soil will cause leaves to turn yellow and fall off. 
 Plant jasmine in a pot with a drainage hole and water enough to keep the soil lightly moist. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity around jasmine. Central heating and A/C can cause the humidity to drop drastically indoors. Discover easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Give your jasmine plant cool temperatures (40-60°F/4-16°C) for 6 weeks in fall to set buds. The rest of the 
 year, average to warm temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C).  
 Soil: 
 Any good potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer. Don't fertilize 
 in spring after the flowers fade, while the plant is resting. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in early summer and root them in moist soil.

 Kaffir Lily 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Clivia miniata 
  
  
  
  
 A summer flower out in the garden, Kaffir Lily can be forced into bloom indoors in late winter or early spring. 
 This member of the amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) bears clusters of 10-15 trumpet-shaped flowers above a 
 thick, upright stem. Bright orange flowers with yellow centers are the most common; however, sometimes you can find rarer peach, yellow or white varieties. Rarer still are cultivars with variegated leaves. 
 Dark-green strappy leaves are 2 in (5 cm) wide and can reach about 18 in (45 cm) long and last year-round. 
 Wipe off the leaves with a damp cloth to keep them dust-free and shiny. 
  
  
 How to Make Clivia Bloom 
  
 Give Kaffir Lily a cool, dry rest for 6-8 weeks in fall to make it bloom. If you live where winters are cold, you can keep the potted clivia on your porch or patio f 
 or a month before the first frost, then bring it 
 back inside and keep it in a cool room until midwinter. 
 After this rest, the increase of water along with normal room temperatures will 
 bring a spectacular show of blooms in March or April. Show off your blooming clivia on a plant stand for all to admire. 
  
  
 After the Bloom 
  
 Cut off the spent flower head. Wait till the flower stem begins to shrivel before cutting 
 it off at the base of the plant. You can continue to display the plant -- its glossy fan of leaves will still be attractive. 
 Don't be too quick to repot. This beautiful bloomer flowers best when it is slightly pot-bound and can stay in the same pot for 3 years or more. 
 Its thick, fleshy roots often appear on the surface of the soil. Just top dress every year by topping with fresh soil as needed. Plants get bigger and better over the years, so it's a good idea to use a heavy pot to prevent your plant from toppling. Or slip a plain pot into a decorative cachepot to dress it up. Don't worry -- a stylish cachepot won't upstage this magnificent houseplant. 
  
 Kaffir Lily Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  Up to 18 in (45 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, no direct sun. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist in spring and summer. In fall and early winter, water sparingly just to keep plant from drying 
 out completely. Gradually increase watering in midwinter. 
  
  
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% 
 relative humidity) or higher. Humidity tends to plummet indoors in the winter, so it's a good idea to use a 
 pebble tray or room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Winter through summer, average temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C. In fall, a cool rest of 40-55°F/4-13°C 
 is needed for 6-8 weeks for clivia to re-bloom. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, peat-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring to fall with a high-phosphorous fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Division. This plant's thick, fleshy roots are somewhat fragile. Carefully detach offsets with roots from the parent 
 plant immediately after flowering and pot in separate containers. You can expect blooms when clivia miniata is at least 3 years old.

 Kohleria Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Kohleria 
 spp. and hybrids 
 These tropical beauties are easy to grow and are prolific bloomers. They have an upright growth habit and 
 can quickly grow tall. You may have to stake your plant to hold up those gorgeous crimson flowers. Or prune the stems to keep your plant small. Don't worry -- this is a vigorous grower. By pruning, your plant will branch out, giving you a fuller plant and more flowers. 
  
  
  
  
 Tubular flowers are around 2-inches (5 cm) long, and grow in clusters of 3 or 4. You have several cultivars to choose from, in a range of colors: red, 
 reddish-orange, pink and purple. Inside each flower are dots and dashes, making these bright bloomers a standout among your indoor plant collection. 
 All parts of Kohleria are fuzzy, covered with fine red hairs. You'll especially notice them around the scalloped leaf edges, creating a stunning contrast against the lush, velvety green foliage. 
  
 We Are Family 
  
 Kohleria is in the Gesneriaceae family, along with popular houseplants African Violet, 
 Gloxinia, Flame Violet 
 and Lipstick Plant. 
  
  
 Year-Round Kohleria Care 
  
 Shed some light. 
  Put your plant where it'll get plenty of light, but out of direct sun. Filtered light 
 from a south- or west-facing window will give it the light it needs. Kohleria also grows well under a grow light. 
 Water regularly. 
 Keep the soil evenly moist during the growing season, but take care not to overwater. 
 Soggy soil will quickly cause the rhizomes to rot. 
 Dry soil will cause the plant to go dormant. If this happens, don't give up on it. Resume normal care and you'll see your plant growing again. 
 Get the most blooms. 
 You can expect dozens of blooms on plants in spring and summer. You'll get the 
 most blooms by providing plenty of bright, indirect light. Don't forget to fertilize it, too. 
 Prune it back. 
  Those soft, succulent stems will eventually grow long and lean over if they're not pruned. Don't be afraid to prune this vigorous grower. You can cut the stem at any height you want. Cut just after a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached) because cuts made here will cause the stem to branch out, creating a fuller plant with more flowers. Don't toss out those stem cuttings, either -- propagate them for more plants. (See "Propagation" below.) 
 To repot...or not? 
 This one likes to be slightly pot-bound, and blooms best this way. Repot in spring only 
 when it is bursting out of its pot. Always use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot.

 Kohleria Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Colombia 
 Height: 
 1-2 ft (30-60 cm). You can stake plants if they start leaning. Or prune them back. 
 Light: 
 Kohleria needs plenty of bright light to bloom. Keep out of direct sunlight. You can keep it flowering almost year-round with a  
 grow light 
 . 
 Water: 
 Spring through fall, water thoroughly and allow the top 2 inches (5 cm) to dry out between waterings. 
 In winter, water just enough to prevent leaves from wilting. Rhizomes store water so it's more tolerant of 
 dry soil than wet. Fine hairs cover the soft leaves -- and flowers, too -- that can trap moisture and cause spots, so be careful not to splash water on them. 
 Humidity: 
 Prefers relative humidity above 50%, but will tolerate lower levels. Use a cool-mist room humidifier or a humidity tray to maintain moist air. Don't 
 mist this plant because the hairy leaves will trap moisture, which will cause spots and possibly  
 botrytis 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C year-round. Don't expose your plant to temps below 60°F/16°C; this South American native doesn't like the cold at all. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix with perlite added for good drainage. African violet potting mix 
 is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer (such as 10-30-10) diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide rhizomes in spring and pot separately. Or take 4-inch (10 cm) leaf tip cuttings with at least 
 1 pair of leaves attached and root in moist potting mix. Cover the whole thing with plastic or put in a glass cloche to hold in moisture. Keep in bright, indirect sunlight. 
 Cuttings root easily in about 4-6 weeks. Once rooted, remove plastic covering and set plant where you want to display it.

 How to Grow Lantana Plants 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Lantana camara 
 Colorful flower clusters have long made lantana plants a favorite for flower beds and borders. They've made their way indoors -- small plants are a beautiful sight in a sunny window. Their scented 
 blossoms are attractive to butterflies, too, if you choose to move lantana to your porch or patio for the summer. 
  
  
  
 Sunshine is the key to lots of lantana flowers. A sunny porch gives it more blooming power. 
  
 The Lantana genus is in the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and includes 150 species of flowering perennials. 
 Lantana camara 
 is by far the most cultivated species and includes 100s of beautiful cultivars to choose from. 
 Flower clusters, called umbels, are available in a range of yellow, orange, red, white, pink, 
 lavender and purple. 
 Two or three colors are often present on each flower head with the flower buds opening in 
 succession from the outside ring toward the center. 
  
 Lantana is a prolific bloomer in a sunny window, giving a big show of color for several months. 
  
 Buy Lantana Plants 
  
 You can buy lantana plants and seeds in garden centers or online nurseries. 
 Countless varieties are available.  
 Lantana camara 
   
 'Sundancer' 
  is a yellow lantana 
 cultivar with a spreading habit suitable for a hanging basket. 
 'Chelsea Gem' 
 has yellow, orange and orange-red flowers... 
 'Patriot Hot Country' 
  is 
 stunning in pink, orange and bright yellow... 
 'Patriot Cowboy' 
  lantana is compact, 
 reaching about 1 ft (30 cm) high, and is a prolific bloomer with yellow flowers that 
 turn bright orange. 
  
 The ovate, toothed leaves are dark-green and deeply veined. Lantana leaves are slightly toxic, so take care 
 when growing these flowers, lantana can cause illness if ingested. Another caution: this plant is fast-growing 
 and can be invasive if grown in the garden. That's another good reason to grow it in a pot. 
  
 Year-Round Lantana Tips 
  
 Pinch and prune 
 . Pinch off growing tips to keep lantana compact and to encourage branching. Some 
 cultivars are compact and may not need pinching at all. Pruning lantana in late winter will bring more blooms. 
 Cut stems back to about 5 in (13 cm). 
 Deadhead spent blooms 
 to encourage more flowers. You can keep your lantana blooming for months on end 
 as long as it gets enough sunlight. 
 Repot in spring 
  when the roots are growing through the bottom of the pot. Move up to a pot only 1 
 size larger. Lantana flowers best when slightly pot-bound. 
 Watch for whiteflies 
 that like to attack lantana plants. You'll find these tiny, white moth-like 
 insects lurking under leaves.  
 Get rid of whiteflies 
  
 as soon as you notice them because they multiply quickly. 
 Overwinter your plant 
 . Lantanas are evergreen, but frost-tender. Bring your potted lantana plants indoors when the temperature drops in autumn, and you'll enjoy those colorful flowers a little longer. When flowering is over, give it a rest. Continue to give it lots of sun and keep it cool (about 
 50°F/10°C) in winter. Water sparingly, just enough to prevent the potting mix from drying out. 
  
 Lantana Plant Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Central and South America 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 ft (1.8 m); Easily kept to 1 ft (30 cm) indoors with regular pinching and pruning lantana. 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun. 
 At least 6 hours of direct sunlight will make lantana flower. Keep your plant in a sunny window or move it outdoors for the 
 summer to give it the light it needs to bloom. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist, not soggy spring through fall; slightly drier in winter. Established plants will tolerate drier soil. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high (around 50% relative humidity or higher). Stand plant on a tray of wet pebbles to  
 increase humidity 
 . 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C. Lantanas are cold-hardy 
 to USDA Zone 9, if you put them outdoors. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based potting mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks with a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half while plant is 
 growing. 
 Propagation: 
  Take stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. They'll root easily in moist soil. 
 Lantana seeds are easy to germinate. If you want to collect seeds from your plant, allow some flowers to go to 
 seed in the fall. Store seeds in a cool, dry place then sow them indoors in early spring.

 How to Grow Lily of the Valley Flowers 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Convallaria majalis 
  
  
  
  
  
 Fragrant lily of the valley flowers are a delight when they bloom in spring. But why wait? These types of lilies 
 are easy to bring into bloom indoors in the middle of winter. 
 Sweetly scented clusters of nodding bells are nestled between pairs of broad, pointy tipped leaves. Once the flowers fade, they're followed up by a show of red berries. 
  
 Don't let this lily's delicate appearance fool you. This hardy plant is a vigorous grower. It spreads quickly 
 from rhizomes and will need to be potted up or divided each year. 
 You'll find lily of the valley plants for sale in nurseries and online florists' delivery 
 sites already potted or shipped bareroot, ready for planting. 
  
 Lily of the Valley Varieties 
  
 Several good varieties are available.  
 Convallaria majalis 
 'Fortin's Giant' has large white 
 blooms and is good for forcing. 
 'Prolificans' and 'Flore Pleno' are stunning with double flowers and 'Rosea' has charming pale-pink flowers. 
 'Variegata' and 'Green Tapestry' are varieties with creamy white-striped leaves. 
  
 The "secret" to keeping lily of the valley flowers fresh for several weeks is to keep the plant fairly cool. 
  
 Did you know... 
 Lilies of the valley are classified in the lily (Lilaceae) family, but were once in a class all their own -- Convallariaceae. 
 These pristine, white bell-shaped blooms are often given as gifts and symbolize purity and happiness. Lily of the valley 
 flowers are popular in wedding bouquets, and also used to celebrate May Day in Europe. 
 Is lily of the valley poisonous? Yes. All parts of lily of the valley are highly poisonous to people, cats and dogs. 
  
 How to Get Lily of the Valley Flowers to Bloom Again 
  
 Beautiful lily of the valley flowers will bloom for about 4 weeks, then can be brought back into bloom the next year. 
 Here are the steps: 
  
  
 When flowers die, keep soil lightly moist and give your lily indirect sunlight until it goes dormant, typically in late summer or fall. 
 Wait till the foliage turns yellow and withered, then cut it back. Don't pull the leaves off with your hands. Use sharp scissors or pruners to avoid damaging the rhizome. Put the dormant plant in a cool, dark spot giving it just enough water to prevent the rhizomes from drying out completely. 
 Dormant rhizomes can be restarted in winter or spring. This is a good time to divide them. Pot 5-6 rhizomes together for an attractive planting, using fresh soil. Place rhizomes horizontally, root-side down and top with just enough soil to cover the rhizome. Put the pot back in a warm (about 65°-70°F/18°-21°C), bright spot (out of direct sun) and keep the soil lightly moist. Blooms should appear in 6-8 weeks. 
  
 Lily of the Valley Care 
  
  
 Origin: 
  European and Asian woodlands 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 in (25 cm) 
 Light: 
 Low to bright light. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist, not soggy. Established plants will tolerate drier soil. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry; take a look at these easy ways to  
 raise the humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average temperatures 60-70°F/16-21°C. Lilies of the valley are cold-hardy 
 to USDA Zone 2, if you want to plant them outdoors. Their natural bloom time is in late spring. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite for faster drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half while plant is 
 growing. Do not feed while dormant. 
 Propagation: 
 These lilies grow from creeping rhizomes that spread quickly under the soil. Divide lily 
 of the valley plants when they become crowded. Cut the rhizomes apart, leaving some 
 roots attached to each piece. Lilies grown indoors will not set seed, but you can grow them from purchased seeds.

 Lipstick Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Aeschynanthus radicans 
 Easy-care Lipstick Plant is ideal for a hanging basket. Putting it at eye-level will show off its 
 thickly leaved trailing vines with spectacular flowers. 
  
  
  
  
 In their native rain forest habitat, these evergreen plants grow as  
 epiphytes 
 , perched on trees, where 
 their long vines sprawl along moss-covered branches. Give these tropical flowering house plants 
 the same dappled sunlight and humidity and they're extremely easy to grow. 
 The thick, glossy leaves are 2-4 in (5-10 cm) long and cover the trailing stems, making this vine a lush, 
 tropical accent for your home. 
 The real attraction, though, is its tubular flowers that emerge from a calyx in bright colors that 
 look like lipstick in a tube. Most often, you'll find them in red, but some rarer varieties have dark red, orange, yellow 
 or coral blooms. 
  
  
 Aeschynanthus Varieties 
  
 You'll find several species of 
 Aeschynanthus 
 labeled 
 Lipstick Plant 
 or 
 Lipstick Vine. 'Variegated'  
 has a creamy white leaf 
 variegation and bright red blooms. 
 'Fireworks' 
 , 
 'Frostfire' 
 and 
 'Flash' 
 are all showy hybrids with fiery red flowers. 
 'Mona Lisa' 
 is a prolific bloomer with clusters of red flowers. 
  
 Caring for Lipstick Plant Year-Round 
  
 To repot...or not. 
  Lipstick plants don't mind being repotted. Repot in spring or summer when the roots 
 fill the pot, moving it up only 1 pot size. Keeping the plant slightly pot-bound will help it to bloom. 
  
 Pruning Tip 
  
 Always prune after a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached to the stem). Use sharp, clean pruning shears -- to avoid jagged tears and disease. 
  
  
 Prune it back. 
  Prune back stems after flowering as needed. You can cut up to 1/3 of the plant to prevent it 
 from getting leggy and to encourage branching. Flowers grow near the tips of new stems, so you'll get more blooms this way. 
 Raise the humidity. 
  If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a pebble tray or cool-mist room humidifier 
 to increase the moisture in the air. Regular misting helps, too. Remember that hanging plants are exposed 
 to warmer air near the ceiling that can dry them out faster. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
  Giving this plant a slightly cooler, drier rest in winter will promote more blooms 
 in spring and summer. Stop fertilizing during this time and keep the plant in bright light. Keep it away from 
 heat vents and cold blasts from doors and windows. 
  
 Lipstick Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southeast Asia 
 Height: 
 Trailing stems up to 2 ft (60 cm) long. 
 Light: 
  Bright light with some direct sun in winter. 
 Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. 
 Place your plant in a bright location and you 
 can expect flowers all spring and summer. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly spring through fall, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Keep 
 the soil slightly drier in winter when growth is slower. Wrinkled leaves are a sign of dry soil. Yellow leaves usually indicate too much water. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to keep relative humidity around 50% or higher. Discover easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. This tropical native doesn't like temperature swings -- keep it away from heat/AC vents and cold drafts from doors and windows. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based potting mix. Added perlite will help to aerate the roots and speed up drainage, 
 preventing waterlogged soil. African violet potting mix is ideal for Lipstick Plant. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half. Use a fertilizer that is high-phosphorus to help it bloom (such as N-P-K 15-30-15). Do 
 not feed in winter. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4-6 in (10-15 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer.

 Madagascar Jasmine 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Stephanotis floribunda 
  
 Add spectacular fragrance to a room with Madagascar jasmine. It's a beauty, too. Those long thick vines 
 are densely covered with glossy, evergreen leaves and an abundance of white star-shaped flowers. 
  
  
  
 Jasmine-like tubular flowers open up to 5 spreading lobes, anytime from spring to autumn. 
  
 About those Fragrant Flowers 
  
 Clusters of creamy white, tubular flower buds arise from the leaf axils. Give your plant plenty of light, 
 and you can expect a profusion of 5-petaled, waxy flowers from spring through autumn. Each beautifully scented bloom lasts for several days. 
  
 How fragrant? 
  One small plant is enough to fill a whole room with a delightfully sweet scent. Also called Hawaiian Wedding Plant, the pristine white blooms are popular for bridal bouquets. 
 No blooms? 
  Lack of sunlight is the top reason for lack of flowers. Put your jasmine plant 
 in a sunny window, sunroom or greenhouse to give it the light it needs. Young plants may not bloom much, so 
 be patient -- the wait is worth it. 
  
 Stephanotis Floribunda Problems, Solutions and To-Dos 
  
 Prune it back. 
 After the flowers fade, prune stems back harshly. Plants that aren't pruned back will 
 eventually have bare lower stems as they shed old leaves. Flower buds develop on new growth, so you'll get more 
 blooms this way. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Prune back in late fall or early winter to control its size 
 and to prevent bare stems. It's a good idea to keep the vine to around 2-3 ft (60-90 cm). 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
  only when the roots have filled the pot. Madagascar jasmine blooms best when slightly pot-bound, so 
 use a smallish container or you may see a lot of leaves and few flowers. 
 Support your vines 
 . You can easily train it around a hoop or over a small  
 trellis 
  inserted in the pot. 
 Tie it to the support with florist wire as it grows. 
 Flowers falling off? 
  Dropped flower buds and flowers may be caused by sudden changes in light, temperature or moisture. See care tips below. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Wet, peaty potting mixtures may draw  
 fungus gnats 
 . They're tiny and black -- hardly noticeable, but you may see them stirring when you water your plant. Look under the leaves and you may find  
 scale insects 
 . You can scrape them off with your fingernail, but it's also a good idea to treat any infested plant with insecticide. 
 Yellow leaves? 
  You overwatered. 
 Use a pot with drainage holes for water to escape. 
 Allow the top couple inches of the potting medium to dry out before watering again. You can cut off any yellow leaves, if you want. This vigorous vine will replace them. 
  
 Madagascar Jasmine Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) or more, if not pruned back. 
 Light: 
 Jasmine needs bright, indirect light to bloom. Shade from hot, direct summer sun. Once it grows flower buds, don't move Madagascar jasmine around; changes in light -- even by turning the plant around -- may cause the buds and flowers to fall off. 
 Water: 
 Spring through fall, water thoroughly until water comes out the bottom of the pot. Allow the soil 
 to dry out a bit before watering again. Keep barely moist in winter, after flowering is over. If the plant wilts, it's too dry. Overwatering 
 will cause leaves to turn yellow and fall off. 
 Humidity: 
 Ideally 60%. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a  
 room humidifier or humidity tray 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Give this tropical jasmine warm temperatures (65-75°F/16-24°C) year-round. It will 
 tolerate temps down to 50°F/10°C.  
 Stephanotis floribunda 
  doesn't like fluctuating temps, so keep them away from drafty windows and doors, or heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix with a handful of perlite or horticultural sand  added to improve drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Stem cuttings do not root easily, but here's how: Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in early summer, dip cut 
 ends in hormone  
 rooting powder 
  and stand them in moist perlite. Maintain warmth (75°F/24°C) for the cuttings; it's a good idea to use a seedling heat mat. Sow seeds in spring.

 Flowering Mandevilla Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Mandevilla 
 hybrids 
 Big, trumpet-shaped flowers cover mandevilla plant from spring through fall. 
 Scrolled flower buds open to reveal red, white or pink petals with yellow throats or all-yellow blooms.

 This evergreen sub-shrub has vining stems densely covered with glossy, dark-green oval leaves. 
 Train your plant. 
  Provide a trellis 
 to support its vigorous, twining stems and to show off 
 those glorious mandevilla flowers. Use plant ties 
 or florist's wire to hold each mandevilla vine in place. 
 Tie the vines loosely so that you don't restrict growth. You may have to re-tie your plant as it grows. 
 Or place it on a plant stand or hang it up. Those leafy stems and gorgeous blooms are sure to capture attention when you display them at eye level. 
  
 Give your Mandevilla lots of sunshine to get beautiful blooms. Photo by  
 Peter Holmes 
  
 Mandevilla Plant Care 
  
 Let the sun shine in. 
  Put your plant in a sunroom or by a sunny window. Moving your mandevilla outdoors 
 for the summer will give it more blooming power. A semi-sunny spot outdoors is ideal. Just be sure to bring it back 
 inside before the temperature drops to 55°F/13°C at night. 
 Repot in spring. 
  Mandevilla is one of the few flowering plants that grow well in a large container. Move 
 it up 1 pot size every spring as necessary. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent root rot. 
 Prune it back. 
  Unless you want a huge shrub in your home, pruning mandevilla is necessary. To control its size, 
 prune it back in late fall -- by half when necessary. Mandevilla flowers at the tips of new branches, so you'll get more 
 blooms this way.  
 Pinch off spent blooms 
 to encourage more flowers. 
 Yellow or dropped leaves 
  are usually caused by overwatering or too-cold temperatures. 
 Keep your plant warm year-round and cut back on watering. 
 Overwinter your plant indoors. 
  Mandevilla is tropical, not hardy. Unless you live in a year-round warm climate, 
 bring your plant inside for the winter. 
 It will tolerate a minimum of about 55°F/13°C. Water sparingly in winter, but don't allow the soil to dry out completely. 
 Growing mandevilla plant indoors is a little work, but worth it. You'll be rewarded with several months of bright and bold trumpet flowers. 
 Treat it right and you'll enjoy your flowering mandevilla plant for many years. 
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 Mandevilla was formerly known as  
 Dipladenia 
  and is sometimes still sold under that name. 
 You can buy mandevilla flowers in nurseries in the spring and summer or order flowers online. Choose a plant with plenty 
 of flower buds -- a sure sign of a healthy plant. 
 More than 100 cultivars offer beautiful varieties to choose from. Good cultivars include  
 'Alice du Pont' 
 and  
 'Magic Dream' 
 . 
  
 Mandevilla Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  10 ft (3 m) or more if not pruned back. 
 Light: 
  Bright light with some direct sunlight. Plants that don't get enough light will grow tall and leggy, 
 with few blooms. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly and allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Put mandevilla plant in a pot with 
 drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
 If relative humidity falls below 50%, use a cool-mist room humidifier or place the pot 
 on a tray of wet pebbles. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm 65-85°F/18-29°C 
 Soil: 
  Use a fast-draining potting mix. You can use an all-purpose mix and add a little perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks with a high-phosphorous fertilizer while plant is 
 growing and flowering. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. Cuttings root easily in moist potting mix.

 Martha Washington Geranium Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pelargonium domesticum 
  
  
 Martha Washington geranium gets its name from a once-popular cultivar. Although newer 
 Pelargonium 
 hybrids outshine 'Martha Washington', the name stuck. Today, that early cultivar has been replaced 
 by more vigorous hybrids, with a wide range of spectacular flowers to choose from. These hybrids are also commonly 
 known as Regal Geraniums. 
  
  
  
 Big, velvety red and white flowers make this Pelargonium a stand-out. Image by  
 Foto-Rabe 
  
 This is a large group of complex hybrids. All have naturally branching stems and dark-green, crinkled leaves. 
 Thick, succulent flower stems bear upright clusters of flat-petaled flowers. Geranium colors 
 include white, pink, red, maroon, salmon and purple -- in many captivating combinations. The top 2 petals often have 
 a bolder color or a contrasting pattern. 
  
 You'll find these hybrid geraniums for sale in late winter, when they're in bloom. 
 Many good varieties of 
 Pelargonium domesticum 
 are available to choose from. Here are a few... 
 'Maiden' varieties are compact, making them ideal for a sunny windowsill. 'Pompeii' is another compact 
 plant, featuring stunning, nearly black petals edged in white. 'Carisbrooke' has big, pink flowers splashed 
 with dark red. 
 Martha Washington geraniums bloom in late winter. If you're growing geraniums indoors, you'll need to give them 
 a little help with the seasons...a rest in summer and a cool autumn will make them set flower buds. 
  
 How to Make Your Martha Washington Geranium Re-Bloom 
  
  
 Cut it back 
 . In summer, after flowering stops, cut plant back to 4-inch stems (10 cm). 
 Repot 
 . After flowering, repot your plant just to give it fresh soil. Geraniums bloom best if slightly pot-bound, so you can keep it in the same pot. Just be sure it has drainage holes to prevent overwatering -- geraniums don't like their feet wet. 
 Give it a rest 
 . Allow the plant to rest for the summer. Water sparingly and stop fertilizing during this rest. Keep it in indirect light. 
 Cool it off 
 . Give your Martha Washington geranium 2 months of cool temperatures to set flower buds. For the "cooling off" period, move your plant outside in fall when the nighttime temperature drops to 50°F/10°C. Or you can  keep it in a cool basement or garage, where it will get plenty of indirect light. Resume normal watering and fertilizing during this cool treatment. 
  
 After following the steps above, you should see flower buds midwinter, and enjoy beautiful blooms in February or March. 
  
 Martha Washington Geranium Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 1-2 ft (30-60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, and allow surface of soil to dry between waterings. Cut back on watering 
 after flowering, but don't allow the roots to dry out completely. 
 Brown spots on leaves are caused by a  
 fungus 
 . 
 Cut off affected stems and leaves. Treat your plant with a fungicide if needed. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter, causing brown leaf tips. Discover easy ways to  
 raise the humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Winter through summer, normal room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). In fall, 
 2 months of cool nights (50°F/10°C) will trigger flower buds. 
 Soil: 
 Peat-based soilless mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 3 weeks fall through spring with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem cuttings in spring and root in fresh potting mix.

 Medinilla magnifica 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Medinilla magnifica 
  
 This tropical shrub bears drooping clusters of rosy pink flowers, giving it a common name of Rose Grape. 
  
  
  
  
 One of the most elegant flowering plants you can grow indoors,  
 M. magnifica 
  is every bit as magnificent as its name. 
 However, it's not easy to please unless you can provide the high humidity this tropical native craves. Use every means to increase 
 the moisture in the air around it. 
  
 Did you know... 
  
 Medinilla is a genus in the Melastomaceae family that includes about 150 species. They're all natives of the tropics from southern Asia, western Africa and the Pacific islands. 
  
  
 Pairs of thick, glossy green leaves cover the upright stems. The leaves get big -- up to 1 ft (30 cm) long -- and are 
 deeply veined with wavy edges. 
 In spring, given enough light and humidity, you can expect long, pendulous flower stalks to grow from the tips of the branches. 
 The flower heads are spectacular. Clusters of small, pink flowers are carried beneath 2 or 3 tiers of pink bracts. 
  
 Caring for Medinilla Magnifica Year-Round 
  
 Cut it back. 
 After flowering, prune the plant back by as much as half to control its size. 
 Wondering whether to repot? 
 Repotting is probably only needed every couple years. Put 
 Medinilla magnifica 
 in a big container. If you want to control its size, keep the plant in the same pot 
 and top-dress it every year. 
  
 How to Top-Dress: 
  Remove the top 2-3 inches of potting mix and replace with 
 fresh mix every couple years. Take care not to harm any roots that may be near the surface. 
  
  
 Winter Care. 
  Give this evergreen shrub a dry, cool rest in winter. It will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C in winter. 
 Cut back on water -- but don't allow the soil to dry out -- and stop fertilizing during this winter rest. Maintain high 
 humidity with a cool-mist room humidifier. Added humidity also helps to prevent an invasion of 
 spider mites 
  that are attracted to dry conditions. 
  
 Medinilla Magnifica Care Tips 
  
 Photo courtesy of Marschef 
  
 Origin: 
  Philippines 
 Height: 
 Up to 4 ft (1.2 m) 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil evenly moist spring through fall. Water sparingly in winter, keeping the plant 
 barely moist. 
 Humidity: 
  
 High humidity 
 is a must. It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor near your plant, rather than guess. Indoor air can become extremely dry during the winter months.  
 If the relative humidity drops below 60%, use a cool-mist room humidifier  
 or set the plant on a tray of wet pebbles. 
 Temperature: 
 Warm (70-75°F/21-24°C); slightly cooler in winter with a minimum temperature of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based mix, such as African violet potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a high-phosphorous fertilizer (such as 10-20-10) diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Division or take cuttings in spring.

 Growing Miniature Roses Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Rosa chinensis 
  hybrids 
 If you're growing miniature roses indoors, you'll have success with these tips for miniature rose care. 
 Miniature rose plants can be found for sale in florist's shops around Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. Although these pint-sized beauties 
 are popular gifts, they're really better off as temporary house guests. Their true home is outdoors, where they'll 
 thrive in the sunshine and fresh air. 
  
  
  
 Countless cultivars of mini rose bushes have given us a beautiful variety. 
  
 Nearly every garden has space for growing miniature roses. Plant them in borders, or in front of your tall rose bushes. If you don't have 
 a spot in your garden, you can keep your minis in pots on your sunny porch or patio. 
 Their petite 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) flowers are available in a big range of colors, including red, pink, peach, orange, white, 
 yellow, and many combinations.  
 Some are shrubs and some are climbing. Train climbing miniature roses on a small trellis. 
  
 Miniature Rose Varieties 
  
 Dozens of excellent varieties are available. The difficult part is choosing among them. 
 Award-winning 'Cupcake' blooms abundantly in pale pink...'Innocence' is white with a blush of pink... 
 'Caliente' is stunning with bright-red blooms and glossy foliage. 
 Orange-red 'Starina' gets top honors from the  
 ARS 
 ... 'Lavender Lace' has large, mauve blooms... and 'Beauty Secret' 
 is rich, radiant red. 
 Among the tiniest minis are white 'Cinderella' and 'Popcorn'... pink 'Bo Peep'... and yellow 'Littlest Angel'. 
 Looking for a fragrant mini rose? All the Scentsation varieties have an intoxicating fragrance. 
  
 Given plenty of bright sunlight, you can expect blooms in summer. 
  
 Miniature Rose Care 
  
 Let the sun shine in. 
  These mini and micro hybrids won't bloom if they don't get enough sunshine. 
 When growing miniature roses indoors, it can be challenging to find a spot where they'll 
 get several hours of direct sun each day. If you don't have space in a sunny window, you can move your rose outdoors, as long as 
 there is no danger of frost. 
 Water regularly. 
 Flowering roses are thirsty, and they dry out quickly in containers. 
 Stick your finger in the soil to check for dryness every day or two, especially if you're growing miniature roses outdoors. 
 Deadhead spent blooms. 
 Remove flowers as soon as they fade to keep plants looking their best and to encourage 
 a long blooming season. Don't pluck them off with your hands because tearing can damage the stem.  Use sharp pruners to 
 avoid tearing the stems, which can attract disease. Cut at a 45° angle. 
 Pruning miniature roses. 
 New plants won't need pruning. As they get older, you'll want to remove 
 dead branches or any cross branches that rub against each other. Don't be afraid to prune it back hard in fall, after flowering. Yearly 
 pruning will promote vigorous new growth as well as the overall health of your rose. It also gives it an attractive shape. Use clean, 
 pruning shears 
 to cut the stem at a 45° angle, 1/4-inch above a leaf axil. 
 Repot year-old roses. 
  Potted plants or gift baskets sometimes contain more than 1 rose plant per pot. This is a good 
 time to divide them. Tease apart roots with your fingers, removing as much of the original soil as possible and plant separately in small pots 
 with drainage holes. Repot in fall, after the flowering season is over. 
  
 Miniature roses are popular gifts -- and elegant plants for a sunny window. 
  
 Overwintering your plant. 
 Roses go dormant in winter and will drop their leaves. Giving roses a rest period in winter 
 will prolong the life and health of the plants. Keep them cool during this time. 
 They're cold-hardy, but if you're growing miniature roses outdoors, protect them from freezing temperatures by covering 
 them with a layer of mulch. Move container-grown roses to a basement or garage for the winter so that roots don't freeze. 
 Miniature rose plants are just as susceptible to the same ailments that afflict any other roses. 
 Damp conditions can cause 
 blackspot 
 to develop on the leaves. It's a fungus that needs to be treated right away. Cut off affected leaves and treat foliage 
 with a fungicide 
 specially made for blackspot. Good air ventilation will help to prevent fungus. Fortunately, newer rose hybrids are 
 more and more resistant to diseases. 
 Yellow leaves 
 that drop off can be a symptom of a few things. Lack of sunlight, dry soil, and dry air will cause 
 roses to shed their leaves. Resuming good care of miniature roses will help them recover. 
  
 Tips for Growing Miniature Roses 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrids with parents from China 
 Height: 
  Up to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, with as much direct sunlight as possible while plant is growing. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly and allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings. Keep soil barely moist in winter. Avoid 
 getting water on the leaves, which can cause blackspot. 
 Humidity: 
  Maintain at least 40-50% relative humidity. Use a  
 humidity tray or room humidifier 
 . 
 Rose buds that shrivel up before opening may be suffering in the dry air of a heated home. 
 Prune off the shriveled buds and raise the humidity around the plant. Moving the plant outdoors 
 may be just the cure. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C will suit growing miniature roses fine. Established 
 plants will tolerate varying temperatures. If you move your rose plant outdoors, don't worry -- it can take the heat. And roses are cold-hardy, but potted plants, especially, need extra protection from frost. 
 Soil: 
 Any good potting mix with neutral pH (pH 7). 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus fertilizer (such as 6-12-6) that contains micronutrients, diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 inch (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in early summer. Dip cut ends in  
 rooting hormone powder 
  and plant 
 them in moist potting mix. Maintain high humidity.

 Plectranthus 'Mona Lavender' 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Plectranthus 
  hybrid 
 'Mona Lavender' is a fast-growing perennial shrub that's fast becoming a favorite house plant. 
  
  
  
 This shade-lover is an exciting new cultivar that's perfectly suited to growing indoors. Few other 
 plants bloom so dependably indoors, for so many months, and fewer still are as easy to grow as "Mona."

 Upright stems are densely covered with dark-green ovate leaves with toothed edges. The glossy leaves 
 are evergreen with purple undersides, making this a beautiful house plant year-round. 
 Just when most plants are slowing down in autumn, this flowering beauty sends up tall spikes of tubular lavender 
 flowers spotted with purple. It's the shorter daylight hours that trigger blooming, so don't put it under artificial lights. 
 You'll likely enjoy flowers right through the winter and into spring. 
 Pinch and prune. 
  Pinching off new stem tips will promote branching and keep the plant compact. ( 
 Don't 
 toss them out 
 -- you can easily propagate them for more plants.) Flowers grow at the tips of new branches, 
 so you'll get more blooms this way. Also, cut off flower spikes when flowers have faded to encourage more blooms. 
 Repot in spring 
 after flowering is over. Move up to a pot only 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger to give it a little 
 room to grow. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which leads to root rot. 
 Problems with this plant are few. Hot, direct sun and dry soil will kill it. 
 You can keep your plant indoors year-round. But if you move it outdoors for the summer, keep it 
 shaded from direct sun. 
 Also, check the soil every couple days so that it doesn't dry out. 
  
 Mona Lavender Buying Tip 
  
 'Mona Lavender' 
  is a newer cultivar. If you're unable to find it at your local garden center, 
 ask for it. It's well-worth growing. You may find it available at online nurseries. 
  
  
  
 'Mona Lavender' Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Tropical South Africa 
 Height: 
  2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect light year-round 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, then allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40-50% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter; it's a good idea to use a humidity gauge near your plant, rather than guess. 
 Use a  
 pebble tray or cool-mist room humidifier 
 , if needed. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) suit this tropical plant just fine. 
 Aim to keep it warm year-round. If you put 'Mona Lavender' out on the patio for the summer, bring it back in 
 when the temperature drops. It won't tolerate frost. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite for good drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks with water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. They'll root easily in 
 moist potting mix or water. Sow seeds in spring.

 New Guinea Impatiens 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Impatiens x hawkeri 
  hybrids 
 Growing New Guinea impatiens in containers allows you to enjoy a big show of bright blooms just about anywhere. 
 Brighten up a kitchen windowsill, sunroom or patio with these non-stop flowering plants. 
  
  
  
 New Guinea impatiens are among the easiest flowering plants to grow indoors. 
  
 These New Guinea hybrids feature a shrubby habit and large flowers. Impatiens flowers are typically single, 
 with 5 flat petals. New varieties offer more choices than ever before. You'll find them in shades of pink, red, mauve, purple, orange and white. 
 Part of the attraction with New Guinea impatiens hybrids is the foliage: lush, lance-shaped leaves are bold 
 and often tinged with red-bronze, or splashed with bright green or yellow. 
 Impatiens are sometimes called "Busy Lizzies" for their ability to bloom for months on end. 
 Among the most popular flowers for shade, you'll find impatiens 
 for sale in garden centers in spring and summer. 
 Don't be afraid to buy small plants or grow impatiens from seed. Impatiens are fast-growing -- 
 you won't wait long for those beautiful flowers. 
  
 Brighten any room with an abundance of beautiful blooms. 
  
 How to Care for New Guinea Impatiens 
  
 Deadhead spent blooms. 
 Cut off spent flowers to keep plants looking their best and to 
 encourage a long season of blooming. 
 Repot plants. 
 You'll get the most blooms by keeping your impatiens slightly pot-bound, so move up to a bigger pot 
 only when the roots fill the pot. Use a pot with drainage holes to 
 prevent overwatering, which can cause root rot. 
 Growing impatiens outdoors? 
 Extend their bloom time by bringing them indoors when the temperatures drops in fall. Before you bring them inside, check the plants for 
 spider mites 
 . They may invade this plant if the humidity is low. 
  
 New Guinea Impatiens Growing Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  New Guinea 
 Height: 
 Up to 15 in (38 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light; no direct sun in summer. 
 Impatiens won't bloom if they don't get enough light. When growing impatiens indoors, 
 it can be challenging to find a spot where they'll get at least 4 hours of bright, indirect sun each day. Don't 
 have a spot near a sunny window? Move your potted impatiens outdoors -- just keep it shaded from hot, direct midday sun. 
 Water: 
  
 Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy. Flowering plants are thirsty, and they dry out 
 quickly in containers, so check them often. Impatiens will quickly wilt if they are allowed to dry out. They can be quickly revived though with a thorough watering. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim for 40% relative humidity or higher. Place pot on a tray of wet pebbles to  
 raise the humidity 
  around it. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix with added perlite and/or vermiculite for faster drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal for impatiens. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks from spring through fall with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended amount. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. They'll root easily in water or moist soil. 
 Sow impatiens seeds in spring or early summer.

 Oleander Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Nerium oleander 
  
 Oleander plant is an easy-to-grow flowering shrub. That is, if you can meet its need for sunshine. 
  
  
  
  
 Oleander bush has dark-green, narrow leaves that cover its woody branches. 
 Clusters of flat-petaled flowers grow at the tips of the stems and are about 2 in (5 cm) wide. 
 Oleander is a member of the periwinkle family, and the flowers look similar. 
 They're typically pink, but you may also find oleander flowers in red, white, yellow, coral and salmon. They 
 may be single- or double-flowered. Many varieties are intoxicatingly fragrant. 
 You'll find oleander plants for sale in nurseries and online flower delivery sites in spring and summer. Dwarf 
 varieties are best for growing indoors. 
 'Petite Pink' 
 is a compact dwarf oleander variety and a prolific bloomer.  
 'Petite Salmon' 
 is another dwarf 
 variety with salmon-pink flowers. 
  
 Soft-pink double blooms make this oleander plant even more alluring. Image by

 Caring for Oleander Plant Year-Round 
  
 Prune your plant 
 . Pruning oleander will force the stems to branch out, giving you a much more rounded 
 and attractive plant. Don't be afraid to prune large plants back hard in fall, after it stops flowering. 
 Yearly pruning will promote vigorous new growth as well as the overall health of your plant. Oleander produces 
 flowers at the end of new stem tips, so you'll get more flowers, too. 
  
 Oleander pruning tip: 
  Cut the stem at a 45° angle, 1/4-inch above a leaf node 
 (the place where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem). Use clean, sharp pruners 
 to avoid tearing the woody stems. 
  
  
 Overwintering oleander 
  indoors will protect this frost-tender shrub. If you keep your plant outdoors 
 for the summer, bring it back inside when the temperature drops to 55°F/13°C at night. Some varieties are hardier 
 than others, but they generally don't like the cold at all. 
 Repot in spring 
 when the roots are growing through the drainage holes of the pot. This is one plant 
 that doesn't like to be crowded, so move it to a pot 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger. It's a vigorous grower and grows well in a container. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Two pests bother oleander,  
 aphids  
 and  
 scale 
 . 
 If you move your potted oleander outdoors for any length of time, 
 watch for these pests on the stems and undersides of the leaves. Treat any infestation immediately. 
 Is oleander poisonous? 
  Yes, all parts of this plant are extremely poisonous. Don't grow this plant indoors if there are children or pets around. 
 Oleander poisoning can cause serious illness or death.

 Oleander Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Mediterranean 
 Height: 
 Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) 
 Light: 
 Bright light with at least 4 hours of direct sun each day. 
 Oleander plants thrive in warm, sunny locations. Move your plant outdoors to the patio for the summer, if necessary, to 
 give oleander the sunlight it needs to grow and bloom. 
 Water: 
 Water generously throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist. 
 Water sparingly in winter when growth is slower. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
 Warm 70-85°F/21-29°C during active growth; 55°/13°C in winter 
 Soil: 
 8 parts all-purpose potting mix, 1 part sand, 1 part perlite 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with fertilizer specially made for oleander. 
 Propagation: 
 Oleander plant is easy to propagate from cuttings. Take 4-in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings 
 in early summer, remove lower leaves. Dip cut end in  
 rooting hormone 
  for best results, then insert in moist 
 potting mix. Keep it in bright light. It will start to grow roots in about 2 weeks.

 Pansy Plants 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Viola x wittrockiana 
  
 Velvety flowers in a rich range of colors have made pansy plants long-time favorites. 
 Easy to grow, pansies are well-suited for flower beds and borders, and make good container plants -- alone or 
 mixed with other types of flowers. 
  
  
  
  
 Those charming pansy "faces" are made up of 5 flat petals: 2 top, 2 side, and 1 lower petal. 
 Typically, 2 or 3 colors are seen on each flower. The side and bottom petals often have contrasting blotches or veins 
 radiating from the center of the bloom. 
  
  
 Hybrids have brought us a wide variety of colors and patterns to 
 choose from, including purple, blue, violet-blue, yellow, red, pink and white. Some purple 
 hues look almost black. And some newer hybrids have solid colors. 
 Packs of pansy flowers are easy to find in garden centers or online nurseries. Choose a plant with plenty of buds that are just beginning to open -- a sign of a young, vigorous plant. 
  
  
 Pansy is a biennial, although it is usually bought in bloom, treated as an annual and tossed in the compost bin 
 at the end of the season. You can keep it indoors to extend the bloom time. 
 Biennials have a 2-year life cycle. Grown from seed, they produce foliage the first year, then 
 flower, set seed, and die the second year. Many newer pansy hybrids have been bred to bloom the first year. 
 Low and compact, pansies are ideal for containers. Or plant them in hanging baskets at eye-level for all to admire. If you don't have a spot outdoors, put pansies on your sunny windowsill. 
  
 Growing Pansies 
  
  
 Pinch off flowers after they fade 
 to promote more blooms. It's work, yes -- but you'll have a long growing season by pinching spent flowers. 
 Got a reluctant bloomer? 
 Lack of sunlight or too-high temperatures will make pansy plants fail to flower. Yes, 
 pansies are a little wimpy. Shade them from direct sunlight during the hottest part of the day. 
  
 Pansy Plants Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrids with origins from England 
 Height: 
 Up to 8 in (20 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. Pansies like it cool, so if you live where the summer is hot, keep 
 your plants in partial shade. 
 Water: 
  
 Keep the soil moist at all times, but 
 don't over-water 
 . Dry soil will cause flowers to fade quickly. If you're 
 watering regularly and the plant wilts, root rot or stem rot is likely. These are the most common problems with this plant. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity around the plant. Place pot on a  
 tray of wet pebbles 
  to increase humidity. Don't mist them indoors 
 because pansies are susceptible to  
 powdery mildew 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C. If you grow them outdoors, they're 
 winter hardy to USDA Zone 4. Pansies like cold better than heat, even tolerating a little frost. 
 Soil: 
 Any good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow pansy seeds in early spring. Drop them on top of moist potting mix, then barely cover them 
 with mix. Seeds will germinate at room temperature. Don't expose them to sunlight until they've sprouted.

 Paperwhite Narcissus 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Narcissus jonquilla 
  
 Paperwhite narcissus bursts into 
 snowy white clusters of blossoms 
 . Discover how to make these beauties bloom indoors -- and last for weeks. 
  
  
  
  
 Paperwhite narcissus is easy to force into bloom indoors. 
 The bulbs do NOT need to be placed in cold storage to bloom 
 . 
 Paperwhite bulbs begin to grow as soon as they are planted, with fragrant flowers appearing in 4-6 weeks. 
 Each tall flower stem produces several small, snowy-white flowers. 
 Make your flowers last longer by keeping the plant in a cool location. Blooms will look fresh for 3-4 weeks if kept at 
 a maximum of 65°F/18°C. 
 Looking to buy paperwhite bulbs? Choose paperwhite bulbs that are firm, not soft or mushy. 
 There are a couple popular varieties I recommend: 
 'Ziva' 
 is a prolific bloomer... and 
 'Ariel' 
 is especially fragrant. 
 Paperwhites are also sold as kits for the holidays. They're foolproof -- 
 just add water. 
  
 Steps to Forcing Paperwhite Narcissus into Bloom 
  
  
 Plant paperwhite bulbs in a shallow pot filled with potting mix. Set as many bulbs as will fit in the pot, as close together as possible without touching. Top with potting mix, leaving the tips of the bulbs exposed. 
 Water thoroughly to moisten the soil. 
 Place in a cool (50-60°F/10-24°C) low-light location until shoots appear, usually in 2-3 weeks. Then move pot into warmer temperatures and a brighter location, but out of direct sun. Turn the pot once in a while so that all the stems get equal light. They're fast growers, with blossoms appearing in 4-6 weeks from time of planting. 
  
 The clusters of small, white flowers last about 3-4 weeks. 
  
 How to Grow Paperwhites in Pebbles 
  
 Paperwhites can be grown without potting mix. Here's how:  
 Cover the bottom of a shallow container with pebbles (or glass marbles) about 2-3 inches deep. Set the paperwhite bulbs on the pebbles with their tips pointed up. Cover the bulbs with more pebbles, leaving their tips exposed. 
 Add just enough water to reach the bottoms of the bulbs. 
 Set them in a cool location and give them the same care as described in #3 above. 
  
 Paperwhite Narcissus Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Asia and Southern Europe 
 Height: 
 12-15 in (30-37.5 cm). 
 Plants often need staking to stay upright. 
 Light: 
 Low to bright, indirect light. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist, but not soggy because the bulbs may rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average 50-65°F/10-18°C. Too-warm temperatures will shorten the life 
 of flowers and may cause flower buds to shrivel and turn brown. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix (or use pebbles as described above). 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer at half-strength from planting until blooming. 
 Do not fertilize while in bloom. 
 Propagation: 
 Paperwhite narcissus bulbs cannot be forced into bloom again and can be discarded.

 Passion Flower Vine 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Passiflora caerulea 
  
  
  
 Passion Flower vine is immediately recognizable by its big, spectacular blooms that appear in late summer and fall. 
 Those unusual blue and white flowers are about 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) across. Five petals, five sepals, and fine violet-blue filaments surround prominent green anthers, making passion flowers among the most extraordinary and exotic-looking you'll find anywhere. 
 After a long, hot growing season outdoors, the flowers are followed by small 
 yellow or orange egg-shaped fruits that are edible but full of seeds. But don't expect it to bear fruit indoors. 
  
  
 A few Passion Flower facts will help you know and grow this plant. 
 It is native to the South American rain forests where it clings to the trunks of trees using its tendrils. 
 Indoors, this tropical plant needs warmth, direct sun and humidity 
 to grow well. Because of its need for full sun and high humidity, it can be somewhat difficult to please in a home and will 
 grow best in a  
 greenhouse 
 . 
  
 Train Vines on a Trellis or Hoop 
  
 Those fast-growing, vigorously climbing vines are thickly covered with lobed dark-green leaves. 
 To show off its leafy vines, and to give them a denser appearance, loop them around a wire hoop or 
 trellis 
 and tie loosely with florists wire. You can trim vines as you go. 
 Pruning passion flower vine does no harm and will help keep it under control.

 How to Prune Passion Vines 
  
 Cut the stems back in spring, just before its heaviest blooming time, but be careful not to remove any flower buds. Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems. You can cut stems down to 10-inches (25 cm) long, if you want. 
  
 Overwintering Passion Flower Plant 
  
 This South American beauty needs a winter rest.  
 When the flowering season is over, reduce watering and stop fertilizing. Give your plant cooler temperatures, as low as 50°F/10°C during this rest. Low light levels are fine. When spring begins, resume normal care. 
  
 When to Repot 
  
 Repot young plants in spring, when plants are beginning their most vigorous growth. Older plants can be top-dressed instead, removing the top couple inches (5 cm) of soil 
 and replacing it with fresh soil. Don't overpot -- you'll get the most flowers if its roots are a bit crowded in the pot. 
  
 Something Bugging Your Plant? 
  
 Dry indoor air can sometimes attract  
 spider mites 
  to houseplants. You'll first notice their fine webbing between stems and leaves. Spider mites are extremely tiny and hard to spot -- they're about the size of pepper flakes -- but they can do a lot of damage by sucking plant juices. Treat any infestation immediately and isolate an affected plant to prevent these tiny critters from invading your other houseplants.  
 Raising the humidity around your plant can help to prevent them. 
  
  
 Where to Buy Passion Flower 
  
 You'll find Passion Flower for sale in tropical and sub-tropical regions in spring and summer, and nearly year-round at some online garden sites that offer tropical plants. 
  
 Passion Flower Vine Growing Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South America, from Brazil to Argentina 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) if not pruned back 
 Light: 
 At least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day will promote blooming. It does best in a south-facing room, sunroom or greenhouse. If you don't have a sunny spot for it, use a grow light. Keep grow lights on for 12 to 14 hours a day. Remember to turn off the lights at night; plants need their rest, too. 
 Water: 
 Keep potting mix evenly moist from spring through fall. In winter, provide just enough water to keep mix from drying out. 
 Humidity: 
 Requires moist air (around 60% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry indoors; it's a good idea to use a humidity monitor near your plant rather than guess. Keep your plant away from heat/AC vents that can be drying. To raise humidity, set pot on a tray of wet pebbles or use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . Brown leaf tips are a symptom of dry air. 
 Temperature: 
 55-60°F/13-16°C nights and 70-75°F/21-24°C days. 
 To ensure blooming, give your plant slightly cooler nighttime temperatures. A 15° difference will do. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed with a liquid fertilizer diluted by half once a 
 month spring through fall. I highly recommend organic fertilizer that's safe for indoor plants. Do not feed in winter. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 6 in (15 cm) stem tip cuttings in summer and root in moist potting mix. Keep cuttings warm with a seedling heat mat.

 Peace Lily Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Spathiphyllum wallisii 
 Of all the flowering house plants, Peace Lily care is probably the easiest. In fact, it tolerates average indoor 
 conditions better than many house plants. 
 It's good for you, too. This is one of the best plants for improving air quality indoors. It has one of the top removal rates of toxins such as formaldehyde, ammonia and carbon monoxide from tainted indoor air. 
  
  
  
  
 Blooms usually appear in early summer and last for weeks. The pale green spathe turns white as it opens and surrounds the 
 protruding spadix that is densely covered by its tiny, true flowers. 
 When flowers start to fade, cut off the flower stalks as close to the base as possible. 
  
  
 No blooms? 
 Plants that fail to bloom usually aren't getting enough 
 sunlight. Move your plant to a brighter location, but keep it out of direct sun, which can scorch leaves. Got an 
 older plant that refuses to bloom? If you haven't divided it in several years, divide it in spring. This is one of the 
 few plants I know that blooms better after dividing it. 
 Dark-green, glossy leaves are strongly veined and arch away from the plant's base, making this an attractive 
 foliage plant when not in bloom. Keep its leaves dust-free by wiping them with a damp cloth. 
  
 Spathiphyllum Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 When caring for peace lily plants, remember that its leaves will indicate any problems. 
 Brown leaf tips? 
 Brown leaf tips are 
 likely caused by overwatering. Water thoroughly, but don't allow the soil to get soggy. It could also be caused by 
 direct sun. Move it to a shadier spot and be careful not to overwater. 
 Dry, crunchy leaves? 
  
 If the leaves become shriveled and dry, 
 the humidity is too low. You can  
 increase humidity 
  by misting the plant, placing it on a tray of wet pebbles or set it near a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Is Spathiphyllum poisonous? 
  Yes -- according to the ASPCA, peace lily contains insoluble calcium oxalates, which causes intense burning in the mouth. Keep it away from children, cats and dogs who may play with or chew on it, 
 and wash hands thoroughly after handling it. 
  
 Varieties of Peace Lilies 
  
 There are many good cultivars to choose from. Here are a few... 
 'Mauna Loa' 
 is a beautiful and long-time favorite. 
 'Sensation' 
 is also popular. A newer cultivar that's getting 
 attention is 
 'Domino' 
 with marbled green and white foliage. 
 'Petite' 
 is a small variety, ideal for a dish garden. 
  
 Peace Lily Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
  Up to 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, but no direct sun. Will tolerate low light, but may not bloom. Brown scorch marks on leaves are a sign of too much sunlight. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist. Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil, which can cause root rot. Always use room-temperature water to water your houseplants; cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
  Relative humidity of 40% or higher. Shriveled, dry leaves are likely caused by dry air. Indoor humidity can drop drastically in winter and may need a boost. Take a look at these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C) 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced houseplant fertilizer that includes micronutrients, using half the recommended strength. Yellow edges on leaves indicate a deficiency of magnesium and iron. 
 Propagation: 
  Division. Early spring is the best time to divide Spathiphyllum because it is beginning its most vigorous time of growth. Divide it every 5 years or when necessary.

 Madagascar Periwinkle Flower 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Catharanthus roseus 
  
 Plenty of sunshine will make periwinkle flower from summer through fall. 
 This Madagascar native is related to the  
 Vinca 
 species, known for its true-blue flowers. There is a resemblance, but this tropical relative has a beauty all its own. 
 This shrubby plant has upright stems densely covered with shiny, dark-green oval leaves, which feature prominent 
 light-green midribs. 
  
  
  
 Give your periwinkle plant lots of light to give it more blooming power. 
  
  
 Star-shaped periwinkle flowers are small -- only 1 in (2.5 cm) across -- but they cover the plant in abundance if 
 given enough light. Flowers are typically pink with a deep-pink throat. You may also find them in white or pale lavender. 
 You can buy Madagascar periwinkle plant from a nursery or garden center in the spring and summer. 
 Choose one with plenty of flower buds -- a sure sign of a healthy flowering plant. 
  
 How to Care for Madagascar Periwinkle 
  
 Let the sun shine in. 
 Flowering plants need plenty of light to bloom. To help your Madagascar Periwinkle flower, 
 keep your plant where it'll get a few hours of sunlight every day. 
 Or move it outside. 
  Growing periwinkle plant in a sunny spot outdoors for the summer will give it more blooming power. Don't worry -- it can take the heat. 
 Just be sure to bring it back inside before the temperature drops to 60°F/16°C at night. It doesn't like the cold at all. 
 Give it some space. 
  Madagascar periwinkle is a vigorous grower, quickly filling a small pot in a short time. 
 Repot when your periwinkle plant outgrows its pot, moving it up to a pot 1-inch (2.5 cm) larger. Don't over-pot, because a too-large container will hold too much water, which can lead to root rot. Besides, it blooms best when its roots are a little snug. 
 Wondering whether to overwinter? 
  This tropical plant is a tender perennial and can be kept over the winter; however, it likely won't bloom much the second year. Don't feel guilty about tossing it out after the flowering season is over in fall. If you want to keep it, water sparingly and stop fertilizing till you see new growth in spring. Then resume normal care. 
  
 Flowers are small, but this tropical is a prolific bloomer. 
  
 Madagascar Periwinkle Flower Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar 
 Height: 
 12 in (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 Madagascar Periwinkle thrives in full sun, as long as it is well-watered. 
  
 Plants that don't get enough light will grow tall and leggy, 
 with few blooms. Moving it outdoors for the summer may be just the solution. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly and often to keep soil evenly moist. Use a pot with 
 drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
 This tropical native likes moist air. If relative humidity falls below 50%, mist the foliage and place the pot 
 on a tray of wet pebbles. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-85°F/18-29°C. If you move Madagascar Periwinkle outside for the warm months, don't worry -- it can take the heat. However, it will only tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C, so bring it back indoors when the temp drops in autumn. 
 Soil: 
 Use a fast-draining potting mix. You can use an all-purpose mix and add a little perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted 
 by half while periwinkle plant is 
 growing and flowering. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow seed indoors in late winter or early spring. Maintain 70°F/21°C for germination, which takes about 2-3 weeks. New 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings can be taken 
 in spring or early summer and planted in moist potting mix.

 Persian Violet 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Exacum affine 
  
 Typically called Persian Violet, this beautiful flowering house plant isn't a true violet at all. 
 It's in the Gentianaceae family, along with geraniums. 
  
  
  
  
 Violet-blue, 5-petaled flowers are studded with yellow centers -- called 
 eyes 
 -- and rise above a mound of small, 
 glossy, green leaves. The flowers are wonderfully fragrant. Rarer varieties have white or purple flowers, and a few have double blooms. 
  
 Exacum affine 
  is a biennial, although it is usually treated as an annual and tossed out after flowering. If you want 
 to overwinter the plant, prune it back harshly and keep it above 60°F/16°C. You can collect its seeds the second year. 
 Commercial growers raise this flowering plant from seed and it is usually sold as an indoor plant in spring and summer. 
 Choose a plant with plenty of buds that are just beginning to open, and you'll enjoy several weeks of blooms. 
 You may find Persian Violet for sale by other names: German Violet or Arabian Violet. 
 Don't repot your plant while it is in bloom, because it will likely drop its flowers and flower buds. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, set it in a cachepot or other decorative container. 
  
 Make Your Persian Violet Bloom 
  
 With good care, 
 you can expect your "bouquet" of violets to last for several weeks. 
 Pinch off flowers after they fade 
 to promote more blooms. 
 Keep the soil moist at all times, but 
 don't overwater 
 . Dry soil will cause flowers to fade quickly. If you're 
 watering regularly and the plant wilts, root rot is likely. This is the most common problem with this plant. 
 Got a reluctant bloomer? 
 Move your plant to a brighter location, out of direct sun. Raise the humidity around it 
 by placing the pot on a tray of wet pebbles. Sometimes plants are in shock when you bring them home because they are adjusting to new light and humidity levels. Follow the tips 
 here and you should see new buds and blooms in a couple weeks. 
 Dropped flower buds? 
 This is not unusual when you buy a new plant. Plants are stressed by their new environment when you bring them home. Set your plant in bright, indirect light and keep it there. Raising the humidity around your Persian Violet may help. Never repot a plant in bloom, which will also cause buds to drop. 
  
 Persian Violet Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Socotra Island near East Africa 
 Height: 
 8-12 in (20-30 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 For the most blooms, give Persian violet bright filtered light from a south- or west-facing window.  
 Some direct morning sun is fine, but keep out of hot, afternoon sunlight which can scorch the plant. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist, but not soggy. Use a pot with drainage holes, water thoroughly then empty drainage tray. If your plant collapses despite regular watering, it likely has root rot. If this happens, toss it out -- it won't recover. Always use room-temperature water for your tropical house plants because cold water is a shock to them. 
 Humidity: 
 Aim to maintain 50% relative humidity or higher. Place pot on a tray of wet pebbles or use a cool-mist room humidifier near the plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C). Keep the plant away from drafts, including heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
  
 Exacum affine 
  likes slightly acidic potting medium. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Or, use other peat-moss based potting mix with added perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks while the plant is growing and blooming with a water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds will germinate in 2-3 weeks. The seeds are tiny. Sow seeds in winter or early spring 
 on top of moist potting mix in a shallow pot.

 Pineapple Lily Flower 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Eucomis comosa 
  
 Showy flower heads topped with tufts of green bracts make Pineapple Lily a favorite of Southern gardeners. 
 But did you know that you can grow this dazzling beauty indoors? Pineapple lilies grow wonderfully in containers.

 This South African native grows in a ground-hugging rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves that grow to 2 ft (60 cm) tall. The upright flower stems are typically yellow-green, sometimes flecked with dark-red spots. Those stems are sturdy enough to hold up heavy flower heads and won't need staking. 
  
 Pineapple Lily Year-Round Care 
  
 Give  
 Eucomis comosa 
  plenty of light. Some full sun is needed to make this tropical beauty bloom. And when it does -- 
 several flower stems will send up spikes of star-shaped blossoms in summer. 
 You can expect flowers mid-summer that last about 2 months. 
 No blooms? 
  Your Pineapple Lily isn't getting enough sunlight. If you don't have a sunny window for it, move the container outdoors to the porch or patio for the warm months to give it the sunlight it needs. Allowing soil to dry out between waterings will also help to promote blooming. 
 Repot in spring 
  only when necessary. This flowering plant blooms best when pot-bound. Use a pot with 
 drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Overwinter  
 E. comosa 
  in a sunny window. Cut back on watering, but don't allow the soil to dry 
 out completely. Stop fertilizing after flowering is over. In early spring, resume normal care. 
 If you've never grown pineapple lilies, give them a try. Growing these tender perennials in containers is easy and 
 you'll enjoy their gorgeous flowers year after year. 
  
 Pineapple Lily Buying Tips 
  
 You'll find 
 Eucomis comosa 
 for sale at some online nurseries. It may be difficult to find in garden centers 
 unless you live in a tropical or sub-tropical climate. 
 Several varieties are available with white, pink or red flowers. Bright-pink 'Aloha' is one of my favorites, and 'Sparkling Burgundy' is a popular cultivar with burgundy-tinged foliage. 
  
 Pineapple Lily Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 Pineapple lilies thrive in bright locations with some direct sun, making them 
 ideal potted plants for the sunroom or any room that gets full sunlight. Turn the 
 pot each week to give each side light exposure. 
 Water: 
  Water generously throughout the growing season, allowing the potting soil to dry out a bit before watering again. 
 Water sparingly after flowering is finished. Yellow leaves are a sign of over-watering. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain a minimum of 40-50% relative humidity. Closed-up homes with A/C or central heating can cause indoor air to become extremely dry. Discover easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical plants. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to high room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C. If you scoot your container to 
 the patio or porch for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. But bring it back indoors when the temperature 
 drops...these tender perennials will not tolerate temps below 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Plant new bulbs with the pointed end barely sticking above the soil; wait to water and fertilize after new growth appears. Divide offsets in spring every 4 years or when needed.

 Pink Calla Lily Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Zantedeschia rehmannii 
  
 Pink Calla Lily has become favorite house plant, and it's easy to see why! 
  
  
  
 Its charming, funnel-shaped blooms may be pink, rose, lavender or violet. It is a smaller 
 plant (growing up to 16 in/40 cm) than the white or yellow varieties ... and I think much more attractive. Those long, tapered leaves are deep green, 
 often with faint white spots. 
  
  
 They fall under the category of "tender bulbs" because they can't tolerate freezing temperatures. But that makes callas easy to please indoors. 
 You'll find these petite pink callas for sale in nurseries and online flower delivery sites in late winter, spring and summer. 
 You can now buy lilies in florist's shops around the holidays, too. 
 The secret to keeping its blossoms fresh for several weeks is to keep the plant warm and well-watered. 
  
 How to Grow Calla Lilies from Rhizomes 
  
 Soooo...you've purchased your  
 Zantedeschia 
 rhizomes and they're still in the bag. Wondering 
 what to do next?  
 Relax 
 . They're easy to grow. Just keep them warm and moist and you should see 
 those colorful calla blooms in about 8 weeks. 
 Here are the steps to take next: 
  
  
 Pot the rhizomes in a 6- or 8-inch pot, covering with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil. 
 Water thoroughly and empty drainage tray. 
 Set your potted bulbs in a warm, sunny window. These colorful callas won't bloom unless the temperature is 70°F/21°C or higher, even at night. 
 Keep the soil lightly moist until you see the first bit of green leaves poking through the surface. Gradually increase water as the plant grows and blooms. (Flowering plants are thirsty, so don't be stingy with the H2O.) 
 Fertilize only while plant is growing and flowering. 
  
 Wondering what to do after the flowers are spent?

 ... 
  
 How to Get Pink Calla Lily to Re-Bloom 
  
 This beautiful plant will bloom for 4-6 weeks, then can be brought back to bloom the next year. Here are 
 the steps: 
  
 Give 'em a rest 
  
 Flowers are triggered by a cool, dry dormancy for at least 2 months. With this rest, you can force your callas to rebloom for 3-5 seasons. When rhizomes stop producing a good show of flowers, it's time to replace them. 
  
  
 When flowers die, allow the plant to go dormant by gradually reducing the water. 
 Wait till the foliage turns yellow and withered, then cut it back. Leave the rhizomes in the pot and store them in a cool (40-60°F/4-16°C), dark place giving it just enough water to prevent the rhizomes from drying out completely. 
 Dormant rhizomes can be restarted in January to March. Pot them in 6 in (10 cm) pots with fresh soil. Top with about 1 inch of soil to cover the rhizome. Put the plant back in a warm, bright spot (out of direct sun) and keep the soil moist. Blooms should appear in about 8 weeks. 
  
 CAUTION: All parts of calla lilies are poisonous; the rhizome is the most toxic. Keep it out of the reach of children, cats and dogs who may play with 
 or ingest this plant. 
  
  
 Pink Calla Lily Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 12-16 in (30-40 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light 
 Water: 
 After potting pink calla lily rhizomes, keep the potting mix lightly moist. Increase water when plant is growing 
 and blooming. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry, especially when windows are closed up and the furnace is running. It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge, rather than guess. The easiest way to boost indoor humidity is to use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . It is low-cost and your tropical plants will love it. 
 Temperature: 
 Warm (70-85°F/21-29°C) while growing and flowering. Keep plants away from heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix with added perlite for faster drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer diluted by half while plant is 
 growing. 
 Propagation: 
 Rhizomes. See how-tos above for planting rhizomes.

 Pink Quill Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Tillandsia cyanea 
  
 Pink Quill is a member of the bromeliad family of air plants, and gets its name from the plume of bright pink 
 bracts that last for months. 
 Arching, narrow green leaves grow in a rosette with flower spikes appearing in summer. Its pink bracts are densely overlapping, with violet-blue flowers emerging for a brief show. Putting your plant on a plant stand while it's in bloom will give it all the attention it deserves. 
  
  
  
  
 What to Know About These Tropical Tree-Dwellers 
  
 Matching the bromeliad care in your home with that of their native rainforest habitat will keep them healthy. 
 Tillandsias 
  are  
 epiphytes 
 in their native Ecuador and have small roots, mainly used for 
 anchoring themselves on trees. Because the roots don't drink up water, these tree-dwelling plants 
 gather moisture and nutrients through their leaves. 
 Misting Pink Quill plant with water and foliar fertilizer will make it feel right at home. 
  
 Plants will bloom when they reach maturity, usually in 2-3 years. Like other bromeliads, they'll bloom once 
 then produce offsets. Propagating the offsets will allow you to enjoy a collection for many years. 
  
 Given enough light, purple flowers will emerge between pink bracts. Photo: © Sylvia Lim 
  
 No flowers? 
  Pink Quill plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. Move your plant closer to a window, but out of hot, direct midday sun.  
 Brrr 
 ... keep this tropical native warm, too. It needs a temperature of about 75°F/24°C to flower. 
 Something bugging your bromeliad? 
  Although pests are not common, it may get infested by  
 scale insects 
 ,  
 aphids  
 or  
 spider mites 
 . Check regularly for pests and treat any infestation right away. 
  
 Pink Quill Plant and Supplies 
  
  
  
 Pink Quill Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Ecuador 
 Height: 
 Newer dwarf cultivars only reach 10 in (25 cm) tall. Expect it to sprawl out, though. Its long, strappy leaves form a rosette up to 12 in (30 cm) wide. 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light is needed to grow and bloom. 
 Water: 
 Spray with water until leaves are thoroughly wet, 2-3 times a week. 
 The water 
 that runs off should be enough to wet the roots. 
 Do not soak base of the plant, which can cause the flower stem to rot. 
 Use rainwater or filtered tap water for misting your bromeliad. 
 Soft water contains too much salt and some tap water contains chlorine and fluoride that can 
 leave water spots on foliage. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Brown tips on leaves are a result of dry air. The most efficient way to raise the humidity for tropical plants is with a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C suit this tropical bromeliad. 
 Soil: 
  
 This is the only bromeliad from the 
  
 Tillandsia 
 genus that can be grown in a pot. It prefers 
 a loose, fine-grade fir bark mix, such as an orchid mix or one specially labeled for bromeliads. 
 Don't pack it down; keep the mix loose to allow air around the roots. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed once a month in spring and summer with a 
 foliar fertilizer spray specially made for  
 Tillandsias 
 . 
 Propagation: 
 Remove offsets -- called  
 pups 
 -- that grow at the base of the plant when they are 
 at least 3 in (7 cm) tall with a sharp 
 knife and pot shallowly in fresh potting mix. They'll take about 3-6 months to root.

 Growing Plumeria: Care Tips for Frangipani Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Plumeria rubra 
  
 Plumeria care is easy as long as you can meet its needs for warm sunshine and humidity. Vigorous and a prolific bloomer, 
 Plumeria rubra 
 makes a beautiful potted houseplant. 
  
  
  
 Plenty of sunshine will bring on the Plumeria flowers. Image by

 Thick, woody branches carry pointed leaves that grow up to 1 ft (30 cm). 
 Big clusters of fragrant flowers grow like bouquets on branch tips from early summer through fall. 
  
 Frangipani flowers are each made up of 5 overlapping petals. The waxy blooms are about 2 in (5 cm) wide and are 
 available in many shades of pink, red, yellow or white -- or any combination. 
 These flowers are among the most fragrant of any tropical flowering plant. Its essential oil is commonly used 
 as fragrance for perfume, lotion, candles and other scented products. 
 These tropical plants are a common sight in Hawaii, where the fragrant plumeria flowers are used to make flower leis. 
 This Central American native prefers bright light and moderate humidity. If you can give plumeria care t 
 hat it needs, you'll enjoy this spectacular tropical plant in your home for many years.

 Year-Round Plumeria Care 
  
 Repot young plants 
 in spring when their roots have filled the container. Move it to a pot only one size larger. 
 When planting plumeria, care should be taken to choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent root rot. Is it too big to repot? You can top-dress 
 it instead by removing the top 2-3 inches of soil and replacing it with fresh soil. 
 Prune it back. 
  You can control its size and encourage plumeria to branch out by regular pruning. 
 Flower 
 clusters grow from the branch tips, so you'll get more flowers this way. 
 Cut at a 45° angle, just above a node (the place where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem). Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems.  
 Cutting 
 plumeria branches back by 1/3 won't hurt it at all -- this is a vigorous plant. Prune in late winter or 
 early spring. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
 Frangipani tree will go dormant in the winter months, shedding its leaves and 
 requiring a cool rest. Put it in a cool room -- a basement or garage is ideal as long as the temperature doesn't 
 drop below 55°F/13°C. Water sparingly and stop fertilizing until new growth begins in spring. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 Although it's called a frangipani tree, this tropical plant is actually a shrub. Out of 300+ species of 
 Plumeria 
 ,  
 rubra 
 is the best for growing indoors. 
 You'll find plumeria for sale in spring and summer. You have quite a few cultivars to choose from -- in brilliant 
 colors and dazzling combinations. 
 'Candy Stripe' has spectacular yellow-and-pink striped petals. Vibrant 'Hot Pink' is a popular cultivar. 
 'Cancun Pink' is soft pink and a prolific bloomer. 
  
 Indoor Plumeria Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Central America 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) in a container 
 Light: 
 Plumeria care requires bright light to full sun. 
 Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough sun. Growing plumeria 
 require 
 at least 
 5 hours of direct sun each day. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall. Water sparingly in winter, when plant is resting. Yellowing leaves are a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity. Use a cool-mist room humidifier to  
 raise the humidity 
  around the plant. 
 Misting is also a good idea in summer. With plumeria care should be taken to mist the foliage, not the flowers. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C. It will tolerate high temperatures, but if you move it outdoors 
 for the summer, bring it back inside if the temperature drops below 55°F/13°C at night. It's tropical, not hardy. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix. 
  
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed spring through fall with  
 high-phosphorous fertilizer 
  to promote blooming.  
 Propagation: 
 Take 10 in (25 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring. Allow the cut ends to dry for 5-7 days, to prevent the 
 sap from oozing out, before planting in potting medium.

 Pocketbook Plant gets its name from the puffy, brightly colored flowers that look like pouches or slippers. Other common names for 
 this unusual-looking plant are Slipper Flower and Slipperwort. 
  
  
  
  
 Clusters of these glorious, pouch-shaped blooms grow on tall stems above soft, green leaves. The heart-shaped leaves are 
 deeply veined with scalloped edges, and reach 6 in (15 cm) across. 
  
  
 Although their blooming time is short-lived, these unusual house plants are well-worth having around for their cheery spotted flowers. And why buy just one? Display two or three plants together in contrasting colors. Their vibrant blooms also look dramatic beside tropical foliage plants, dressing up a Boston fern or maidenhair fern for a while. 
 Choose a plant with plenty of unopened buds and you'll enjoy several weeks of blooms. 
 Many flower colors are available -- yellow, white, orange, red, maroon or copper, usually with red, purple or brown spots. Popular cultivars include 
 'Anytime Mixed' and 'Gold Fever'. 
 These hybrid plants are available in flower shops in spring, their natural bloom time. 
  
 Find a spot for your plant that is free from drafts and direct sun, both of which will scorch its soft leaves. 
 Check over the leaves and stems for  
 aphids 
 . These tiny pests are attracted to the soft foliage of plants. Treat an infestation right away -- you don't want insects to move on to your other houseplants. 
 Keep pocketbook cool and moist and you'll enjoy its masses of blooms for 
 several weeks. Discard it after flowering has finished. It's an annual and won't bloom again. 
  
  
 Pocketbook Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrids 
 Height: 
  Up to 12 in (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light. Shade it from hot, direct sunlight which can scorch its leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist at all times. This plant may not recover if the soil is allowed to dry out. 
 Avoid watering over the crown of the plant because it may rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Requires moist air. Stand the pot on a  
 tray of wet pebbles 
  to increase the humidity around the plant. Don't mist because water may damage the soft foliage. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool 45-50°F/7-10°C at night; 55-60°F/13-16°C during the day 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Not needed; pocketbook blooms will flower for a season then can be discarded. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow seeds anytime. These hybrids are slow-growing, though. You'll wait 4-5 months for them to bloom.

 Poinsettia Care Tips 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Euphorbia pulcherrima 
 Good poinsettia care will keep your plant beautiful right through the holidays. 
  
  
  
  
 Bright and cheery, poinsettia is the top-selling flowering plant in the U.S. and the most popular for decorating and gift-giving at Christmas time. 
 Its "flowers" are actually leaf-like bracts that surround the tiny, yellow true flowers in the center. Red still rules, 
 but newer cultivars are available in burgundy, white, peach or pink -- some marbled or flecked. They also range from 
 palm-sized miniatures to giant floor plants with bigger bracts than we've ever seen. 
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 There are more than 100 varieties of poinsettia, and the ones available change often as improved and novelty varieties are introduced. Choose whatever tickles your fancy -- just be sure you're getting a healthy plant. Here are some tips: 
  
 Look for plants with small, unopened flower buds in the center of the bracts. 
 Never buy a poinsettia that has been exposed to cold weather for any length of time. 
 Cover with a plastic sleeve to keep it from being chilled on the way home. 
  
  
 Most poinsettias are tossed out after the holidays, or after the bracts have faded. However, with some effort and these poinsettia care 
 tips, you can coax your poinsettia back into bloom before next Christmas. 
  
 How to Make Poinsettia Bloom Again 
  
 When leaves start to fall, water sparingly (just enough to keep soil from drying out completely) and do not fertilize. 
 In early April, prune the plant back to 6 in (15 cm) stems. This will stimulate new growth. Keep your poinsettia in a bright location with regular waterings and begin fertilizing. Once you see new growth, repot it in fresh soil. 
 Poinsettia needs long nights and short days to bloom. Beginning in early October, give it 10 weeks of long nights (14 hours of complete darkness). Put a box over it, or put it in a closet, if you need to so that the plant gets uninterrupted darkness every night. Bring it out during the daytime and put it in a bright (indirect sun) location. 
 Once the bracts begin to show color, resume with normal poinsettia care. 
  
  
 Poinsettia Care Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Dropped leaves? 
  Not enough sunlight and cold temperatures will cause leaves to fall off. Take care to cover your plant while taking it home from the store; even a short-time exposure to freezing temperatures will harm the plant. 
 Wilted leaves 
  are a symptom of soggy soil. This tropical native likes humidity more than water. Allow the potting mix to dry out a bit before watering again, but don't allow poinsettia to dry out either. 
 Something bugging your poinsettia? 
 Look over your plant for  
 red spider mites 
  that are attracted to plants in winter. They're so tiny, you'll likely notice their webbing first. Treat any infestation immediately to prevent pests from moving on to your other houseplants. 
 Wondering whether to repot? 
  Not needed unless you're keeping your poinsettia for another year. If you want to cover a plain nursery pot, slip it into a cachepot -- a decorative container without drainage holes. Cover the bottom of the cachepot with pebbles or small rocks to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Is poinsettia poisonous? 
  
 Contrary to popular belief, poinsettia sap is not 
 lethal, just irritating. According to the  
 Mayo Clinic 
 , eating poinsettia leaves may cause an upset stomach and mouth irritation. Contact with the leaves and sap may cause skin and eye irritation, so it's a good idea to wear gloves when handling it. 
  
 Poinsettia Care Tips 
  
  
 Height: 
  Varies from 6 in (15 cm) miniatures to 36 in (90 cm) tall, full plants 
 Light: 
  
 Poinsettia grows best in bright, indirect light. Some direct morning sun is fine, but hot direct midday sun can cause bract color to fade. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, then allow top of soil to dry out between waterings. Remove the decorative foil to allow good drainage. 
 This plant is prone to root rot if soil is too soggy. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room humidity (around 40% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter; check out these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your tropical plants. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 60-75°F/15-24°C. 
 It doesn't like 
 cold drafts from doors and windows. Exposing it to temperatures below 50°F/10°C can cause its leaves to drop. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Not usually necessary, but if the poinsettia is kept for another season it will benefit from a 
 high-phosphorus fertilizer diluted by half every 2 weeks. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings when new growth starts in spring or early summer. Cuttings will ooze a milky sap that 
 can be stopped by placing the cut end in water before potting it.

 Powder Puff Tree 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Calliandra haematocephala 
  
 Powder puff tree is captivating, covered with big, bright blooms. It's easy to see why it's tempting to grow this tropical as a house plant.

 Those bright red fuzzy "flowers" are actually 
 made up of stamens and can grow to 3 in (8 cm) in diameter. Powder puffs are long-lasting and will cover the tree nearly 
 all year, making this a stunning accent in the home. 
 Calliandra haematocephala 
 needs sunlight, warmth and high humidity to really thrive. If you 
 can meet those requirements, your powder puff tree will do well indoors. A sunroom or greenhouse is 
 an ideal spot for it. 
 Move your plant outdoors for the warm months, if you want, to give it the sunlight it needs. Just shelter it from hot midday sun. This flowering shrub is a favorite of butterflies and hummingbirds. 
  
 Powder puff buds kind of look like raspberries before they open. 
  
 Repot in spring, moving to a pot only 1 size larger. Want to keep your powder puff tree small? Keep it 
 in the same pot and just top-dress every year. 
  
 How to Top-Dress: 
  Remove the top 2 inches (5 cm) of potting mix 
 and replace it with fresh mix. Take care not to harm any roots that may be near the surface. 
  
  
 Calliandra 
  is an evergreen perennial. Its foliage is made up of dark-green, bipinnate leaves, with 
 each leaflet about 2 inches (5 cm) long. Those leaves fold up at night and reopen in the daylight. 
 Over time, this shrubby plant will grow into a tree, reaching several feet high and will spread about as wide. Pruning will help it to branch out, giving Powder puff tree a fuller, bushier look, as well as more blooms. 
 You can prune it back hard in spring to keep it to 3 ft (90 cm) tall. It doesn't mind being cut back. 
 In fact, this tree makes a charming bonsai. 
  
 Calliandra Buying Tips 
  
 Calliandra 
  is a genus that includes about 200 tropical and subtropical flowering plants, 
 shrubs and trees. 
 Red powder puff plant is rare and may be difficult to find in garden centers. Your best bet is to shop for it at online nurseries. 
  
 'Alba' is a rare white cultivar. 
  
 Want a smaller plant? Look for dwarf powder puff 'Nana' that is slow-growing and grows to 
 6 ft (1.8 m). This dwarf variety is easier to keep small with regular pruning. It's a prolific bloomer and makes a beautiful bonsai. 
 'Alba' is a rare variety with white blooms. 
 Give this tree what it wants and you'll find it is easy to grow. You'll enjoy it for many years. 
  
  
  
 Powder Puff Tree Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Bolivia (South America) 
 Height: 
 10 ft (3 m) or more if not pruned back; dwarf  
 Calliandra 
  grows to 6 ft (1.8 m) 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun year-round. Shade from strong, midday summer sun. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist year-round. Yellow leaves are a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high (50% relative humidity -- or higher). Use a humidity tray or a cool-mist room humidifier if air is dry. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C). If you move your plant outdoors for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. Just be sure to bring it indoors when the temperature drops to 60°F/16°C at night. This South American beauty doesn't like the cold at all. 
 Soil: 
  Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Easy to  
 start from seed 
 . 
 Calliandra haematocephala 
 seeds have hard coatings and need to soak in warm water for 24 hours before sowing. Seeds will germinate in about 2-3 weeks. They will also grow from cuttings. Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring, dip cut end in  
 rooting hormone powder 
 , then insert the cutting in moist perlite. Keep the cuttings warm (70°F/21°C) until rooted (it's a good idea to use a  
 heating mat 
  to maintain even temperature).

 Growing Primrose Flowers Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Primula 
  species and hybrids 
 Out of hundreds of primrose flowers species, there are just a few that are available 
 from florists mid-winter through spring and grown as house plants. 
  
  
  
 Give your primrose plant plenty of light and you'll enjoy a long season of blooms. 
  
 How to Choose a Primrose Plant 
  
 English primrose 
  ( 
 P. polyantha 
 ), shown here, produces a mound of bright, fragrant blooms in pink, purple, yellow, 
 red, orange, white, and bicolors, and often have yellow centers, called  
 eyes 
 . Its colorful flowers grow above a rosette of mid-green oblong leaves. 
 Fairy primrose 
 ( 
 P. malacoides 
 ) has star-shaped flowers on tall stems. 
 Another tall variety is  
 German 
   
 primrose 
  -- also called poison primrose, its leaves can cause skin irritation -- 
 ( 
 P. obconica 
 ) with fragrant blooms in shades of white, lilac, red, and pink -- each with a green eye. 
 Chinese primrose 
 ( 
 P. sinensis 
 ) is a small plant with ruffled blooms in shades of pink and lilac. 
 Choose plants with buds that have just begun to open. You'll enjoy several weeks of beautiful blooms. 
  
 Make your primrose flowers last longer by keeping them in a cool spot, lower than 65°F/16°C. 
  
 If your plant came from a florist shop with a plastic or foil wrap around it, take it off. Blocking 
 the drainage holes in the pot may cause the roots to rot. 
 Want to cover a plain nursery pot? Slip it into a  
 cachepot 
  
 (a decorative container without drainage holes). I put pebbles in the bottom to keep the inner pot above the 
 drainage water. 
  
  
 Primrose typically blooms for several weeks and is often tossed out after flowering because it is difficult to regrow. However, 
 P. polyantha 
 can be planted in a shaded spot outside in the garden for more seasons of blooms. 
 The biggest challenges of keeping this indoor beauty happy are its moisture and light requirements. Dry soil or 
 direct sun will make primrose flowers wilt. Find a cool place for your plant. A bright sun porch is ideal. 
  
 Display Ideas 
  
 Set several plants together on a decorative tray. Somehow their bright contrasting colors tend to complement each other in a group. 
 Or display them with other winter-blooming plants, such as kaffir lily,  
 fragrant jasmine or cyclamen. 
  
  
 Primrose Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Pinch off spent blooms 
  to extend blooming time. 
 Brown leaf tips 
 could be caused by dry air or a buildup of soluble salts in the soil. You can easily flush 
 salts by slowly pouring room-temperature water over the soil. Wait till water drains out the drainage holes, then 
 repeat a couple more times. 
 Scorched leaves 
 (dry, brown spots) are caused by harsh sunlight. Keep your primrose plant in 
 bright, indirect light indoors. If you set your plant outdoors in the spring, keep it in full shade. 
 Something bugging your primrose plant? 
  Watch for  
 spider mites 
 . Dry indoor air in 
 the winter months encourages these pests to invade house plants, another reason to keep the humidity up. You'll 
 first notice faint webbing on the undersides of leaves. If your plant is badly infested,  
 get rid of it 
 . 
 These harmful pests will quickly move on to your other indoor plants. 
  
 Primrose Flower Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  England, Germany and China 
 Height: 
 8-12 inches (20-30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. Keep plant out of direct sun, which may cause it to wilt or develop brown scorch marks. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil evenly moist. 
 Primrose flowers need frequent watering to make them happy. Keep an  
 indoor watering can 
   
 nearby so that your plant won't go thirsty. 
 This plant wilts quickly when the soil is dry. 
 Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. Yellow leaves are 
 a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Needs moist air. Set pot on a wet pebble tray or use a cool-mist room humidifier to raise the humidity around it. 
 Don't use a mister because primroses have hairy leaves that trap water, which leads to fungus. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average temperatures 50-65°F/10-18°C. 
 Blooms will stay fresh longer if kept at a maximum of 65°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix, such as African violet mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Do not fertilize when in bloom. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow seeds in late fall for winter blooms.

 Purple Shamrock 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Oxalis regnellii 
  
 Purple Shamrock grows in a clump habit of striking purple foliage. Its triangular-shaped leaves fold along the 
 vein and look like butterflies fluttering above slender stems.

 Many varieties are available, including 'Triangularis' pictured here. Other common names for this plant are 
 False Shamrock and Shamrock Plant. 
 You can expect an abundance of soft-pink flowers to appear in spring and summer. Dainty, five-petaled blooms rise like 
 trumpets above the mounds of purple, clover-like leaves. 
 Don't let its fragile appearance deceive you. This is one of the easiest flowering house plants to grow as 
 long as you can keep it moist and shaded. 
  
  
 Oxalis plants may go dormant if the soil is allowed to dry out or if 
 it's exposed to hot, direct sun. Don't worry, it will come back. Just cut off all the leaves and you'll have a 
 healthy, thriving plant in just a few weeks. 
 Divide this plant or repot it anytime. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. If you want to use a decorative pot without drainage holes, use it as a cachepot. Just slip a plain nursery pot into the cachepot. I put pebbles in the bottom of cachepots to keep the plant above the drainage water. 
 This happy-go-lucky plant seems content to be anywhere. You can grow Purple Shamrock indoors year-round, or move it outside 
 on a shady patio for the summer. It can be planted outdoors in frost-free regions, but it's fast- 
 spreading and can be invasive in the garden. 
  
 Purple Shamrock Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  6-12 in (15-30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect light will give  
 O. regnellii 
 the best leaf color. 
 Leggy, spindly growth is often caused by lack of light. Move the plant to a spot where it will get curtain-filtered light from a 
 south-facing window. 
 Water: 
 Allow surface of soil to dry between waterings. Don't allow the potting medium to dry out. Oxalis is sensitive to the salt buildup from fertilizers. You'll notice it as whitish deposits on the surface of the soil or around the rim of the planter. It's a good idea to flush the soil occasionally to rid the soil of excess salts, which can harm this plant's fleshy roots. Flush the pot every month or two by watering plants thoroughly with room-temperate water. Allow the water to drain through the drainage holes for a half-hour. Then flush it again. Empty the drainage tray afterward so that the plant is not sitting in water. 
 Humidity: 
 This Brazilian native prefers relative humidity around 50% or higher. If indoor air is dry, try one of these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Prefers cool temperatures, especially while in bloom; 55-65°F/13-18°C at 
 night/not warmer than 75°F/24°C during the day. 
 Soil: 
 Any good potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks while plant is growing with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by 
 half. When blooming stops, feed every other month. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide the plant by gently pulling apart its small, tuberous roots into smaller 
 clumps and potting them in separate containers.

 Billbergia nutans aka Queen's Tears 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Billbergia nutans 
 This member of the Bromeliaceae family is one of the easiest to grow indoors...and one of the most striking. 
  
  
  
 Colorful pendant blooms may appear on Billbergia nutans in spring. 
  
 Its thick, strappy leaves 
 arch outward into a fountain shape, making this tropical beauty a graceful accent plant. The foliage 
 can reach up to 15 inches (37.5 cm) tall and about twice as wide, so give this bromeliad plant some room to spread out. 
 You can expect flowers in spring when the plant reaches maturity, usually in 2-3 years. 
 The flowers are pink, purple, yellow or green and are surrounded by red or pink bracts. 
 Billbergia nutans 
  gets one of its common names, Queen's Tears, from the drops of nectar that "weep" from the flowers when the 
 plant is moved or touched. 
 Because  
 Billbergia nutans 
  readily produces offsets that can be shared with friends, it is also commonly known as 
 Friendship Plant. 
  
 For some reason, Queen's Tears is not as easy to find in nurseries as its brome relatives. However, it's easier to 
 please indoors than some and is worth growing. 
  
 Most bromeliads are 
 epiphytes 
 in their native habitat. 
 Billbergia nutans 
 is often found growing on tree branches in the South American rainforests. 
 They have small roots, mainly used for 
 anchoring themselves on trees, so these tree-dwelling plants gather moisture and nutrients through their leaves. 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 Use rainwater or filtered tap water for watering and misting your bromeliad. Soft water contains too much salt and some tap water contains chlorine and fluoride that can leave water spots on foliage. 
  
  
 Repot in spring. 
  Young plants should be repotted every year. Use a loose, fir bark mix, such as an 
 orchid mix or one specially labeled for bromeliads. Never repot a plant while it is flowering. Wait till after 
 flowering to repot the offsets. 
 Got a late bloomer? 
 Bromes that don't produce blooms aren't getting enough light. Move your plant to a 
 brighter location. Moving it outdoors for the summer to a partially shaded spot may be just what it needs. 
 You can encourage bromeliads to flower by adding a pinch of Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) to the water or fertilizer. 
 Still won't bloom? 
  Give it a nudge with this easy trick: 
 Place a ripe apple or a few apple cores around the plant and enclose the whole thing in a clear plastic bag for a week or two. 
 Ripening apples produce ethylene gas that encourages flower buds to form. Keep your plant out of direct sun while it's covered with 
 plastic to prevent it from getting too hot. 
  
 Billbergia Nutans Care Tips 
  
 Photo courtesy of Shu Suehiro 
  
 Origin: 
  Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay 
 Height: 
 15 in (37.5 cm) tall 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light. If you move your billbergia outdoors for the summer, keep it in partial shade. 
 Keep an eye on it so the leaves don't turn red or get scorched from too much sun. 
 Water: 
 Use room-temperature rainwater or distilled water because this rainforest native is sensitive to chlorine and fluoride added to some tap water 
 . Water soil just enough to keep the roots barely moist. 
 Do not soak base of plant, which 
 can lead to root rot. In fall and winter, keep the soil slightly drier. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity or higher. Brown tips on leaves are caused by dry air. Although billbergias are 
 more tolerant of dry air than other bromeliads, they benefit from frequent misting with water to increase the humidity. If your home is especially dry during the winter months, use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
  In spring and summer, warm temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C). In fall and winter, 
 slightly cooler (60-75°F/16-24°C). 
 Soil: 
  Bromeliad or orchid mix is chunky -- ideal fast drainage and also allows air around this bromeliad's roots 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength. 
 In fall and winter, feed once a month. Use a foliar fertilizer, if you want. Bromeliads take in moisture and nutrients 
 through their leaves so you can add fertilizer to water and spray it on the leaves. 
 Propagation: 
 Remove offsets -- called  
 pups 
  -- that grow at the base of the plant when they are 
 at least 6 in (15 cm) tall with a sharp 
 knife and pot separately in fresh potting mix. Wait till after flowering to pot up offsets.

 Red Ginger Flower 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Alpinia purpurata 
 Showy flower spikes topping tall stems make red ginger flower a favorite in tropical climates. 
 In fact, 
 you'll see it growing everywhere in Hawaii. But did you know that you can grow this spectacular beauty indoors? 
 Red ginger plants grow wonderfully in containers.

 Standard varieties will soar to 6 ft (1.8 m) or more. For containers, you'll want a dwarf variety, such as 
 'Red Dwarf' 
 that reaches only about 3 ft (90 cm) tall with lush, compact foliage. Poking up between the red bracts, the true flowers 
 are small, tubular and white. 
  
 Give your plant plenty of light to make this tropical beauty bloom. Flowering ginger makes an ideal potted plant 
 for the sunroom, warm greenhouse or any brightly lit room. Its large leaves and bold color make a dramatic statement in any room. 
 Repot in spring 
 only to replace with fresh potting medium. Red ginger flowers best when pot-bound, so keep the 
 rhizome roots crowded in the container. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 Overwinter  
 A. purpurata 
 in a sunny window. Cut back on watering, but don't allow the soil to dry 
 out. Stop fertilizing after flowering is over. In early spring, resume normal care. 
  
  
  
 You may have difficulty finding  
 Alpinia purpurata 
  for sale in garden centers. Unless you live in 
 Hawaii or south Florida, your best bet is to check some online nurseries. 
 Look for a dwarf variety for growing in a container. 
  
 Red Ginger Flower Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Malaysia 
 Height: 
 Typically 6 ft (1.8 m) or taller; dwarf varieties reach about 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 Ginger flowers thrive in bright locations with some direct sun. Red ginger makes a stunning floor plant in front of a sunny window. 
 Turn the pot each week to give each side equal light exposure. 
 Water: 
 Water generously throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist. 
 Water sparingly after flowering is finished. Yellow leaves are usually a sign of overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Give tropical  
 Alpinia purpurata 
  as high humidity as you can indoors -- 50% relative humidity is ideal. It's a good idea to use a cool-mist room humidifier near the plant, if the air is dry. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. If you scoot your container to 
 the patio or porch for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. But bring it back indoors when the temperature 
 drops...these tender perennials will only tolerate temps as low as 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
 Good-quality, all-purpose potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Pot rhizomes in spring for summer bloom. Don't bury them -- set rhizomes horizontally in the pot, then cover with 1 to 2-inches (3-6 cm) of potting mix. Keep them warm and in indirect sunlight until you see growth. New plants will bloom in about a year after planting.

 Red Spider Lily 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Lycoris radiata 
  
 An elegant-looking plant, Red Spider Lily adds a sizzling burst of color to your home. 
 This is a relative of the amaryllis and is also easy to grow. 
 Just when most flowering plants are done for the season, red spider lily is ready to take their place, with fresh crimson blooms to brighten your home. 
 You can expect clusters of blooms in late summer or fall on top of tall, leafless stems that grow 1-2 ft (30-60 cm) tall. Set your plant on a plant stand where you can admire its curly flowers. (Plus, you do want to show it off, don't you?) 
  
  
  
  
 Strap-like leaves follow the flowers and will stay green through the winter. Allow the leaves to die back naturally 
 before cutting them off. Don't pull them because it can damage the bulbs. 
 Pot up the bulbs as soon as they are purchased. These are warm-natured plants that don't need to be chilled. They'll bloom when they're ready. Don't over-pot. Like the amaryllis,  
 Lycoris radiata 
  likes to be in a small pot and blooms best this way. 
 This is a long-lived perennial and will provide years of beautiful flowers. This lily tends to bloom best 
 after a hot, dry summer followed by a wet season...just like its native habitat. In fact, it gets another common name, 
 Hurricane Lily, from the fact that it blooms during the stormy season in Asia. 
 Wondering whether to repot? This spider lily doesn't like to be disturbed, so divide bulbs only 
 when it gets crowded in its pot. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, slip it into a  
 cachepot 
  -- a decorative pot without drainage holes. 
  
 Red Spider Lily Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  China 
 Height: 
 Up to 24 in (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly while plant is growing and blooming. Use a pot with a drainage hole and empty 
 drainage tray because these bulbs may rot if kept wet. Gradually decrease water after blooming, maintaining barely 
 moist soil in spring and summer. 
 Humidity: 
 Relative humidity of 40-50%. Humidity drops drastically in a closed-up house with the AC or furnace running. It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge and discover ways to  
 raise the humidity 
  for your house plants. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C) 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring to fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Division of bulbs. 
 Like all bulbs in the lily family, these are poisonous, so keep them away from children, cats and dogs.

 Guzmania Lingulata 'Scarlet Star' 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Guzmania lingulata 
  
 This gorgeous red tropical is one of the most common house plants from the Bromeliad family. Other 
 popular cultivars have bright yellow or orange bracts. 
 New varieties of  
 Guzmania lingulata 
 are introduced all the time. Choose what you like -- they're 
 all spectacular. 
 'Orange Star' 
  has long-lasting orange bracts.  
 'Luna' 
  is a popular variety with mauve 
 bracts.  
 'Rana' 
 is a newer hybrid with a slightly larger flower spike than the species, in orange-red. 
  
  
  
  
 Its leathery, glossy green leaves grow in a rosette that creates an urn which must be filled with water at all 
 times. This is the only plant I know of that  
 should 
 be watered in its center and will not rot. 
 After 3 or 4 years, 'Scarlet Star' produces a flower head made of bright red bracts that rise in the plant's center 
 and last about 5 months. Its small, white true flowers are almost hidden by the bracts. 
 Bromeliads add dazzling color and a tropical feel to any room. Get one for your office, too, and make a bold statement. 
 It grows well under the fluorescent light of offices. Keep it out of direct sunlight to prevent the 
 bract color from fading. 
 Guzmania lingulata 
 won't need repotted until it produces offsets. In fact, keeping it in a small 
 container helps promote blooming. 
 If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, just slip it in a decorative container. It's a 
 good idea to place some small rocks in the bottom of the container to keep the nursery pot above the drainage water. 
 Bromeliads have small root systems and won't tolerate soggy soil. 
 Plants bloom once and then die, a slow 
 process that takes up to 3 years. Propagating its offsets -- or  
 pups 
 -- 
 that grow at the base of the 
 plant will give you a collection that blooms year after year. 
  
 Guzmania Lingulata 'Scarlet Star' Growing Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Central and South America 
 Height: 
 About 12 in (30 cm) high. Its leaves can reach up to 18 in (45 cm) long. 
 Light: 
  
 Put this tropical house plant in a bright location out of direct sun. Sun exposure can cause brown spots on leaves. 
 It will thrive in the bright fluorescent light of an office. 
 Water: 
 Water the center of the rosette and keep 1 in (2.5 cm) of water in 
 its urn (center of the rosette) at all times. Bromes are sensitive to the chlorine and fluoride in tap water. Use distilled water or rainwater and allow it to warm up to room-temperature first. Houseplants  
 hate 
  cold water! Water soil just enough to keep the roots barely moist. Empty old 
 water from the urn every week and promptly replace it with fresh water. 
 Humidity: 
 Prefers high humidity. Try to maintain at least 50% relative humidity near your Bromeliad; the most efficient way to do this is to set your plant on a  
 humidity tray or use a cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm (65-80°F/18-27°C). Keep your plant out of cold blasts from windows and doors during the winter. Also shield it from heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 Bromeliad or orchid potting mix. Or mix equal parts fine-grade fir bark and all-purpose potting 
 mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half in the 
 plant's urn, then empty it after 1 week and fill with water. Or mist the leaves with a weak foliar fertilizer 
 once a month. 
 Propagation: 
 Cut off the offsets (pups) when they reach 3 in (7.5 cm) tall and plant them in fresh, barely moist 
 potting mix. Maintain high humidity for the pups for the first month.

 Scented Geranium Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Pelargonium spp 
 . 
 Many types of geraniums are prized. But scented geranium species offer 
 intensely fragrant leaves. Just a brush of your hand across the foliage of these scented-leaf geraniums 
 will give off a delightful fragrance in a spectacular choice of scents. 
  
  
  
 Pelargonium graveolens is a favorite for its beautiful rose fragrance. Image by  
 WikiImages 
  
 Rose scented geranium plants ( 
 Pelargonium capitatum 
 ) have foliage so fragrant that their small, pink flowers are 
 merely an added attraction. Another rose geranium is  
 Pelargonium graveolens 
 , a large, vigorous plant with 
 deeply lobed, finely cut leaves. Lemon geranium ( 
 Pelargonium crispum 
 ) is especially aromatic -- even the slightest touch 
 of its leaves releases a fresh, citrusy scent into the air. 
 Apple geranium ( 
 Pelargonium odoratissimum 
 ) has a delightful apple aroma with a hint of cinnamon. Wonderfully fragrant 
 strawberry geranium ( 
 P. x scarboroviae 
 ) features a compact growing habit. Peppermint geranium ( 
 P. tomentosum 
 ) 
 has a trailing habit with big, velvety leaves. 
  
  
 You can buy geraniums in garden centers and online in spring and summer.  
 Scented geraniums are typically light 
 bloomers, so choose one based on the scent you like. 
 Citrus-scented geraniums have smaller leaves and compact growth, making them ideal for growing indoors on a sunny windowsill. 
 Pelargonium crispum 
 'Peach Cream' has pink flowers and a peach aroma. 
 Rose scented geranium plants ( 
 P. graveolens 
 ), as shown at left, 
 have intricately patterned leaves that look like snowflakes and a beautiful rose fragrance. 
 It is a vigorous variety that should be pinched back often to prevent it from getting leggy. 
  
 Year-Round Care for Scented Geraniums 
  
 Pinch your plant. 
 Pinch off stems regularly to encourage branching and to maintain an attractive shape. Don't toss those cuttings either -- they can be rooted to give you new plants.  
 Also, remove spent flowers to keep your plant looking neat and to promote more blooms. 
 Repot in spring. 
 Geraniums bloom best if slightly pot-bound. Move your plant to a pot 1 size larger or 
 keep it in the same pot and just give it fresh soil. Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy potting medium. Get tips for  
 repotting 
  here. 
 Overwinter care. 
 Most scented geranium plants never go dormant. You can keep your geranium in bright 
 light year-round. Water less in winter because the growth has slowed, but don't allow soil to dry out completely. 
 If you want to give your plant a rest in winter, you can keep it in a cool basement or garage with a minimum 
 temperature of 50°F/10°C. During this rest, water sparingly. 
  
 Scented Geranium Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 12-18 in (30-45 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. 
 Give your scented geranium as much light as you can spring through fall. Move it outdoors for the 
 summer, if you like. Just bring it back indoors when the temperature drops below 50°F/10°C. This is a tender 
 perennial that doesn't like the cold. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, until water runs out of the drainage hole, then empty the saucer. Don't water again until the top couple inches of soil is dry. Cut back on watering 
 in winter, but don't allow the roots to dry out completely. 
 Humidity: 
 This plant will tolerate average indoor humidity (around 40%). If air is dry, use one of these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Cool nights (55-60°F/13-16°C) and warm days (65-75°F/18-24°C) will 
 trigger flower buds. 
 Soil: 
 Peat-based soilless mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 3 weeks spring through fall with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem cuttings in spring and early summer to start new plants. Dip cut end in  
 rooting hormone powder 
 , then insert in fresh potting mix. Keep cuttings moist, but not soggy. Keep the cuttings in bright, indirect sunlight until roots are formed, then move them into full sunlight. Pelargoniums are 
 easy to grow from seeds, too. Start seeds in December for mature plants the following spring and summer.

 Shamrock Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Oxalis 
  species and hybrids 
 Shamrock Plant is cherished for its resemblance to four leaf clovers, making it a popular St. Patrick's Day gift plant. 
  
  
  
 Perhaps you could consider these St. Patrick's Day shamrocks "lucky" because they are easy to grow. 
 These perennial plants thrive in average room conditions, making shamrock care a breeze. 
  
 Did you know... 
  
 Oxalis is not a true clover -- it's in the Wood Sorrell family. Because it looks similar, this plant borrows its "lucky" status from four leaf clovers. 
  
  
 Shamrock plants make great house plants. 
 When grown outdoors, shamrocks have an invasive nature. Their 
 fast-spreading tuberous roots can spread like wildfire. However, when confined to a container, 
 you can put this plant on your windowsill to enjoy the lush, clover-like leaves and charming little flowers up-close.

 Jill Wellington 
  
 Given enough light, you can expect lots of blooms in the spring and summer. The 5-petaled flowers are held 
 on tall, slender stems above the foliage and may be white, pink or red, depending on the species. 
 Folded leaves? 
  Shamrocks fold up their leaves at night, opening them again in the morning light. Cool, huh? 
 Repot in spring 
 , when the tuberous roots have filled the pot. This is a good time to divide the plant. 
 Got a dormant plant? 
  Shamrock plant may go dormant if the soil is allowed to dry out or if 
 it's exposed to hot, direct sun. If this happens, don't worry. And don't give up on it. It may stay dormant for several weeks. Reduce watering, stop fertilizing, and keep the plant cool. 
 When the leaves die back, cut them off. When your plant starts growing again, resume normal care and you'll have a 
 mound of new, green foliage in just a few weeks. 
  
  
 You'll find shamrock plants in florist shops before St. Patrick's Day. The bulbs are also easy to grow -- 
 and to find online. 
 Oxalis deppei, pictured at left, has lobed leaflets and pinkish-red flowers. Sometimes called Iron Cross for 
 the purple-brown markings that form a circle in the center. 
 Purple Shamrock 
  is another popular variety. Its large, dark-purple leaflets make it a beautiful house plant.

 Shamrock Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico 
 Height: 
 6-12 in (15-30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light with some direct sun. 
 Leggy, spindly growth is often caused by lack of light. Move the plant to a spot where it will get curtain-filtered light from a 
 sunny window. 
 Water: 
 Allow surface of soil to dry between waterings. Shamrock plant retains water in its tuberous roots and 
 won't tolerate soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
 Average indoor (around 40-50% relative humidity). If indoor air is dry, you can boost humidity for your plant by setting it on a pebble tray or use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Cool to average 55-65°F/13-18°C at 
 night, not warmer than 75°F/24°C during the day. 
 Soil: 
 Any good-quality potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by 
 half. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide the plant by gently pulling apart its small, tuberous roots into smaller 
 clumps and potting them in separate containers. Don't bury them too deep; set the tubers 1/2" below the soil. Sow shamrock seeds in spring.

 Shrimp Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Justicia brandegeana 
  (aka  
 Beloperone guttata 
 ) 
 Shrimp plant gets its common name from the arching 3- to 4-inch 
 spikes of overlapping bracts that cover this plant nearly year-round. 
  
  
  
  
 The showy bracts range from reddish-brown to coppery pink to golden yellow. You'll get the 
 best color by providing plenty of light. Keep the plant in a bright location where it will get 
 some direct sun. 
 Small, white flowers that appear at the end of the bracts are insignificant and last only a 
 short time. 
 Pinch your plant. 
 Pinch off the growing tips often to encourage branching. You'll 
 be rewarded with a much nicer-looking plant that is compact and bushy. If you want, 
 you can propagate the stem tip cuttings for more plants. 
 This shrubby perennial will last for several years. Its upright, woody stems are covered 
 with velvety, evergreen foliage. The pointed, oval leaves are about 1-3 in (2.5-8 cm) long. It'll 
 get tall and leggy if not pruned back regularly. If you don't prune it, you may need to stake its weak branches. 
  
 Regular pruning is needed to control 
 its growth and to prevent it from becoming leggy. Prune it back hard in early spring -- 
 by half when necessary. 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
  when it has outgrown its pot. You can repot and prune at the same time, you won't hurt this plant at all. 
  
 Justicia Brandegeana 
  Varieties 
  
 You may find this plant classified as either 
 Justicia brandegeana 
 or 
 Beloperone 
 guttata 
 . 
 Cultivars are available with yellow, salmon or brick-red bracts. 
 J. brandegeana 
 'Yellow Queen' 
 has yellow bracts. 'Fruit Cocktail' has yellow and green bracts with pink flowers. 
 You may be able to find Shrimp Plant at garden centers, if you live in a region that is warm year-round. Or look for it at online nurseries. 
  
 Shrimp Plant Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Dropped leaves? 
  Root-bound plants sometimes drop their leaves; repot every year to prevent leaf drop. You'll have a much healthier plant by giving it fresh potting mix. 
 Yellow leaves 
  are a symptom of overwatering. Water thoroughly, then allow soil to dry before watering again. Shrimp Plant is more tolerant of dry soil than wet. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
   
 Whiteflies 
 ,  
 scale insects 
  and  
 aphids 
  are attracted to houseplants, especially during the spring and summer. It's a good idea to look over your plant regularly for any signs (n 
 ibbled, discolored or sticky leaves) of an invasion, 
 and treat any infestation immediately. 
  
 Shrimp Plant Care 
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico 
 Height: 
 Up to 3 ft (90 cm) if not pruned back. 
 Light: 
 Shrimp Plant needs plenty of light to bloom. Give it bright light with as much direct sun as possible. If you don't have a sunny window for it, moving your plant outdoors for the warm months will give it the sunlight it needs to grow. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, a 
 llowing the soil to dry out almost completely before watering again.  
 Yellow leaves are caused by overwatering. 
 Always use a pot with a drainage 
 hole to prevent soggy soil. 
 Water less in winter when growth is slow. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). If air is dry, using a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  is the most efficient way to increase moisture. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. You can move it out to the patio for the 
 summer, if you want. Bring it back in if the temperature drops; it will tolerate a minimum of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
 All-purpose houseplant potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with an all-purpose water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring. Remove the flower bracts from the stem and 
 insert in moist potting medium.

 Siam Tulip 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Curcuma alismatifolia 
  
 For tropical beauty, look no further than Siam Tulip. Its magnificent, upright flowers 
 and handsome green foliage make a gorgeous house plant. 
  
  
  
  
 Cupped petals and tall tulip-like leaves lend the common name, but it's also sometimes called Java Tulip and 
 Hidden Ginger. 
 A member of the Zingiberaceae (Ginger) family, this ornamental belongs to a diverse group, including 
 edible plants. Siam Tulip is purely decorative. In fact, it is poisonous to cats and dogs. The good news is, if you grow it on your patio, deer won't touch it. 
 Once a rare tropical plant, 
 Curcuma alismatifolia 
 is gaining in popularity and is now 
 available from online nurseries in spring and summer. 
 You may find it at your local garden center, if you live in a tropical region. 
  
  
 You'll sometimes find Siam Tulip already in bloom as a gift plant. However, they're so easy to grow from rhizomes, you can easily grow your own plant and save money. 
 Plant rhizomes in spring and you'll enjoy those big, dramatic blooms in summer. There's even a hidden surprise: 
 In addition to the beautiful pink blooms, small violet flowers 
 emerge from the bracts, adding to its charm. 
 Native to Thailand, this tropical perennial is perfectly suited to indoor living in colder climates. It grows well in a pot. 
 Plant Siam Tulip in a well-drained mix, and set in a bright location, out of direct sunlight. 
 Shed some light. 
 Put your flowering plant where it'll get plenty of light, but out of direct sun. If you don't 
 have a spot near a window, fluorescent light works fine. Use 1 warm white tube and 1 cool white 
 tube under a reflector. Place plant about 8 inches (20 cm) beneath the light for 14-16 hours a day. 
 Deadhead spent blooms. 
 Deadheading isn't necessary to keep Siam Tulips blooming, but it will 
 keep plants looking their best. 
 Cut off any dead flower heads and dried foliage. 
  
  
 Give it a winter rest. 
  
 Curcuma alismatifolia 
 will go dormant. Beginning in autumn, decrease watering 
 to allow the leaves to die back naturally. Stop fertilizing during this time. Keep the plant dry and cool (55°F/13°C) until the following spring. 
 Pot rhizomes in early spring. 
  
 Pot rhizomes in fresh potting mix, about 1 1/2- inches (4 cm) deep. For a fuller planting, plant 2 to 3 rhizomes in an 8-inch (20 cm) pot. Water thoroughly and keep warm. 
  
 Siam Tulip Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Thailand 
 Height: 
 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light. 
 These tropical flowers need plenty of bright light to bloom, but keep them 
 out of hot direct sunlight, which can scorch their leaves. 
 Water: 
 Keep the soil lightly moist during the growing season. Use a pot with a drainage hole 
 to prevent soggy soil, which will cause the rhizomes to rot.  
 Humidity: 
 Moderate to high, preferably 50-70% relative humidity. U 
 se a pebble tray or a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  
 to increase the moisture in the air. Grouping tropical plants also helps to maintain the humidity around them. 
 Temperature: 
 Keep at 65-75°F/18-24°C during the growing season. In winter, keep dormant rhizomes  
 cool (55°F/13°C). 
 This tropical native won't tolerate freezing temperatures. 
 Soil: 
 Rich, humusy potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly with a 10-20-10 liquid fertilizer diluted by half while plant is 
 growing and flowering. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide rhizomes in spring.

 Snapdragon Flowers 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Antirrhinum majus 
  
 Dwarf varieties of snapdragon flowers are easy to grow indoors all year long. 
  
  
  
 Love variety? Snapdragon flowers come in a big range of colors, and many bicolors. 
  
 These compact, low-growing snaps are ideal for patio containers, too -- or window boxes and front-of-the-border 
 garden beds. There are rare trailing snapdragons, perfect for hanging baskets. 
 Clusters of colorful blooms grow on upright flower spikes and are available in almost every color imaginable, 
 including bicolors. Dwarfs include 'Magic Carpet' with the traditional pouched bloom, and 'Twinny' with open, 
 ruffled petals. 
  
 How to Get the Most Snapdragon Flowers 
  
 Pinch your plants 
 when stems are 2 to 4 inches tall to promote branching. You'll get more compact plants this way...and more flower spikes. 
 Deadhead spent flowers 
 to encourage more blooms. 
 Shed some light 
  to make snapdragon flowers bloom. Give them as much full sun as you can indoors, 
 setting them directly in front of a sunny window or in a sunroom. Outdoors, snaps will tolerate partial shade. 
 Keep them cool 
 . Snaps thrive in cool weather, giving the best show of blooms in spring and fall.

 Best Snapdragon Varieties for Growing in Pots 
  
 Snapdragons are tender perennials yet treated as annuals. You'll enjoy a spectacular year of flowers before 
 they start to fade. Plan to sow new seeds every year for the best show of flowers. 
 Look for dwarf varieties of Antirrhinum majus for indoor growing. 'Magic Carpet' and 'Tom Thumb' reach no more than 6 inches (15 cm) tall. 'Twinny' varieties 
 are 12 inches (30 cm) high. 
  
 Caring for Snapdragon Flowers 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southern Europe 
 Height: 
 Dwarf varieties are 6-12 in (15-30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Full sun to partial shade 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly and often to keep potting mix constantly moist, but not soggy. 
 Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent root rot. 
 If you're growing them on your patio, check them often so they don't dry out. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). If indoor air is dry, try one of these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your snapdragons. 
 Temperature: 
  
 Snapdragons thrive in cool to moderate temperatures 
 (60-75°F/16-24°C). 
 If you choose to grow them outdoors, it's a good idea to harden off the 
 seedlings before moving them outside in early spring.  
 Snapdragon flowers will tolerate light frost 
 . 
  
 Soil: 
 Good-quality potting mix with added perlite. I use 3 parts mix to 1 part perlite for most garden 
 plant containers. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a high-phosphorus (such as 10-30-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer to get the most flowers. 
 Propagation: 
 Sow snapdragon seeds indoors 6 weeks before last frost date if transferring them outdoors. (They 
 will tolerate light frost if you make the move a gradual one.) Use a sterile 
 seed starting mix, barely covering seeds (they need 
 light to germinate). Keep medium moist, but not soggy at 65-70°F/18-21°C. You can expect to see seedlings poking up in 
 about 10-12 days.

 Spider Lily Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Hymenocallis littoralis 
  
 Elegant, pristine white flowers make Spider Lily plant a joy to grow indoors. This not-well-known member of the Amaryllis 
 family has long, slender segments that radiate from a round center, giving the whole bloom a spider-like look. 
  
  
  
  
 The flowers are delightfully fragrant, with up to 8 flowers blooming on each flower stalk at a time. 
 These types of lilies are sometimes called Beach Spider Lily. Natives to the tropics and subtropics, they like 
 sun, surf and sand. 
 This may help you to remember how to take care of these beautiful lilies. Give them plenty of 
 water throughout the growing season, add sand to the soil for fast drainage and find a spot where they'll get 
 several hours of bright, filtered light. 
  
  
 Overwintering spider lilies 
 indoors will protect this frost-tender plant. If you move your plant outdoors 
 for the summer, bring it back indoors when the temperature drops to 55°F/13°C at night. Cut back on water in winter when growth slows, keeping the potting medium barely moist until new growth begins. 
 Repot in spring 
 when you see new growth, and only when it gets too crowded, probably every 4 years or so. This 
 tropical lily flowers best when potbound. 
 Buying a plant? 
 Spider lily bulbs are rare, but you can sometimes find them at nurseries and online flower delivery sites. These amaryllis relatives are just as easy to grow, and well-worth seeking. Although only summer-bloomers, they add a lot of character to your house plant collection. 
  
  
 Spider Lily Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Central America and Southern Mexico 
 Height: 
 Up to 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect sunlight. 
 Spider lilies thrive in warm, sunny locations. Moving your plant outdoors for the summer will 
 give it the light it needs to grow and bloom. 
 Water: 
 Water generously throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist. 
 Cut back in winter, watering just enough to prevent the soil from drying out completely. 
 Humidity: 
 Maintain relative humidity around 40-50%. If indoor air is dry, use one of these easy ways to  
 increase humidity 
  around your plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Warm 70-85°F/21-29°C during active growth; minimum winter 
 temperature of 60°/16°C 
 Soil: 
 3 parts all-purpose potting mix: 1 part horticultural sand 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Division of bulbs. Separate offsets from the parent bulb in spring and pot 
 them up. Water newly potted bulbs sparingly for the first month or until you see new growth.

 Growing Tulips Indoors: 
 Steps to Forcing Tulip Bulbs 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Tulipa 
  hybrids 
 By growing tulips indoors, you'll bring a bright bouquet of fresh flowers 
 to your home in the middle of winter. 
 Forcing tulip bulbs is not quite as easy to do as some of the other flowering bulbs, but it's well worth 
 the effort. Imagine the colorful, cheery flowers you'll enjoy long before spring arrives. The best time to 
 plant tulips for mid-winter blooms is early October. 
  
  
  
 You have an endless range of tulip varieties to choose, in gorgeous colors. 
  
 Tulip Varieties Best for Forcing Indoors 
  
 You have a gold mine of spectacular varieties to choose from -- in every color imaginable. 
 Take your pick...many with double colors, double blooms, or frilly petals. 
 For growing tulips indoors, you can force any type of tulip bulb into bloom. However, some get pretty tall and will 
 have to be staked to prevent them from falling over.  
 T. batalinii 
 and  
 T. humilis 
 are a couple 
 tulip species that stay shorter, reaching only 6 in (15 cm) high. 
 Triumph tulips are among the most prized because of their big blooms, traditional tulip shape, and variety 
 of colors available. Triumph tulips are also among the easiest to force into bloom indoors. 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 Buy the biggest and best tulip bulbs you can find from a reputable company. After waiting for months for these beauties to bloom, you don't want to be disappointed. For sure success, buy varieties that are labeled "good for forcing." 
  
  
 There are several varieties available that are especially dependable for forcing. 
 I recommend the early-flowering types. You can choose single or double blooms, plain or striped. 
 Some tulips with single blooms include 'Apricot Beauty'... radiant 'Red Riding Hood'... 
 and petite, yellow-and-red 'Guiseppe Verdi' that only reaches 6-12 in (15-30 cm) tall. 
 Double-flower varieties include peachy-pink 'Peach Blossom'... snowy-white 'Schoonoord'... and  
 'Orange Nassau' has orange-yellow blooms with a blush of red. 
 Planting tip: 
  Because each tulip variety tends to bloom at a different time, it's best not 
 to mix them. You'll enjoy a mass of beautiful blooms by planting one tulip bulb variety per pot. 
  
 Steps for Forcing Tulip Bulbs 
  
 Before growing,  
 tulips need a cold treatment for 10-12 weeks 
 . If you bought pre-chilled bulbs, you can skip this step. 
  
  
 Choose a wide pot about 6 in (15 cm) deep with drainage holes in the bottom. Fill the pot loosely with potting mix. Set bulbs side by side -- close but not touching -- pointed end up, so that their tips are even with the pot rim. By facing the flat sides toward the outside of the pot, the first leaves to grow will hang over the edge of the pot. Do not press the bulbs into the mix. It should be loose to allow the roots to grow through it easily. Cover with additional potting mix, just so their noses are barely covered. 
 Water thoroughly and empty drainage tray. 
 Move pot to a dark, cool, but not freezing (40-45°F/4-7°C) location such as a basement, unheated garage or refrigerator. Avoid storing bulbs near ripening fruit or vegetables because they give off ethylene gas which can damage the bulbs. Keep them in cold storage for about 10-12 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist. 
 When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, bring the pot out of cold storage and place the growing tulips in a slightly warmer (50°F/10°C) location with low light. Over the next few days,  
 gradually 
 move it toward a sunny window. (By moving it in small steps while it's growing, tulips will last longer.) Turn the pot every day for even growth. 
 When in full bloom, keep potted tulips in a bright location out of direct sun. Keep as cool as possible to prolong the bloom time. 
  
 Tips for Growing Tulips Indoors 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Asia 
 Height: 
 12-24 in (30-60 cm), depending on variety. Some species only reach 6 in (15 cm) tall. 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light. Rotate the pot once in a while because 
 growing tulips will tend to lean toward the light source. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil lightly moist. Growing tulips are thirsty, so it's a good idea to check the soil often. 
 Humidity: 
 Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
 Cool 60°F/16°C. Make your tulips last longer by keeping them in a slightly cooler location. Blooms will last for weeks if kept at 
 a maximum of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
 Any good-quality potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Tulip bulbs cannot be forced a second time indoors. They do produce offsets, but they can take a few 
 years to mature. If you want to keep them, allow the foliage to die back naturally, storing tulip bulbs in a cool, dry place. Plant the bulbs 
 in your flower garden in the fall and let Mother Nature take care 
 of them.

 Urn Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Aechmea fasciata 
  
  
 Urn plant is an exotic-looking flowering plant from the bromeliad (Bromeliaceae) family. 
 Aechmea fasciata 
 grows in a rosette of stiff, arching leaves that form an urn. In its native South American rain 
 forest, the 
 leaves gather rain water in its urn, which must be filled with water at all times. Brown leaf tips are a sign that the plant is too dry. 
  
 Bring a fresh splash of tropical color to your home with easy-care Aechmea fasciata. 
  
 Despite its exotic appearance and tropical nature, this bromeliad adapts well to living as a potted house plant. 
 Urn plants are often bought at garden centers or florist's shops already in bloom. They have shallow root systems and won't need repotted. 
 Want to hide a plain nursery pot? Slip it into a 
 cachepot 
 -- a decorative container without drainage holes. I put small rocks in the bottom of my cachepots to hold plants above the drainage water. As the water evaporates, it adds humidity around the plant. 
  
  
  
  
 In mature plants (3 years old), the mottled, silvery green foliage is upstaged by a crown of long-lasting pink bracts. 
 Between the bracts, small violet flowers appear that quickly turn red. The flowers themselves are short-lived, but the bracts 
 last for a few months. 
 Got a late bloomer? 
 Plants that don't produce bracts aren't getting enough light. Move your plant to 
 brighter location. 
 Still won't bloom? If it still won't produce a flower stem, you can encourage it to bloom with this easy trick: Place a ripe apple or a few apple cores around the plant and enclose the whole thing in a clear plastic bag for a week or two. The apple gives off ethylene gas that promotes blooming. Keep your plant out of direct sun while it's covered with the plastic bag to prevent it from getting too hot. 
  
  
 Like other bromeliads, urn plant only blooms once then dies. Allow the plant to die back naturally. After flowering, 
 you can expect each plant to produce 2-3 pups. Remove them when they are about 5 months old and at least 6 in (15 cm) 
 tall and pot them in their own containers. 
 Propagating its offsets that grow at the base of the plant 
 will allow you 
 to enjoy these beautiful bromeliads for years to come. 
 You may find Urn Plant sold by other common names: Silver Vase Plant or Vase Plant, or by its botanical name, 
 Aechmea fasciata 
 . 
 Some striking varieties are available, such as 'Variegata' with creamy yellow stripes on its leaves. 
 'Purpurea' has silvery leaves blushed with maroon. 
  
 Urn Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  Up to 20 in (50 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light with some direct sun. With this bromeliad plant, care should be taken to move plant 
 to direct sun gradually to avoid scorching its leaves. A few hours of morning sun is ideal. 
 Water: 
 Keep the plant's urn filled with water at all times and change it weekly. 
 Water regularly to keep the soil lightly moist, but not soggy. Don't allow the urn 
 to dry out for very long. 
 Brown, shriveled leaf tips are likely caused because the plant is dry. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain a relative humidity around 50%. Take a look at these easy  
 ways to raise humidity 
  for houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C 
 Soil: 
 Orchid potting mix or mix equal parts: fir bark, peat moss and sharp sand or perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half in the 
 plant's urn, then empty it after 1 week and fill with water. Or mist the leaves with a weak foliar fertilizer 
 once a month. 
 Propagation: 
 Cut off the offsets -- called  
 pups 
 -- when they are at least 6 inches tall and plant 
 them in fresh, barely moist potting mix.

 Walking Iris 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Neomarica 
  spp. 
 Walking Iris is a rare house plant, but it is puzzling why. This beautiful bloomer has an easy-going nature and 
 will bloom dependably in late winter to early spring (March-April in the Northern Hemisphere). 
 Neomarica 
 spp. grows in a clumping fan of long, strappy leaves, making this an elegant plant even when not in bloom. 
 However those blue-and-white flowers that appear every year are simply stunning -- and delightfully fragrant. Three large petals 
 are held horizontally, while three small contrasting petals are curled. Although the flowers are short-lived (often lasting a day) 
 you'll enjoy a succession of blooms. 
  
  
  
 Neomarica is an exotic-looking iris from South America and makes a stunning houseplant. 
  
 This tropical member of the Iridaceae family gets its common name from its unusual propagation habit. New plantlets 
 grow at the tips of the flower stems, weighing them down until they bend to touch the ground and take root. The new plants 
 will eventually repeat the process, causing the iris to "walk" across the garden. Not all  
 Neomarica 
 species 
 walk --  
 N. caerulea 
 has sturdier stems that stay upright. 
  
 Walking Iris Varieties 
  
 Several species exist. Among the most popular, 
 Neomarica gracilis 
 and 
 N. northiana 
 sport large white petals 
 with brownish-red, tiger-striped patterns and bright-blue curled petals. 
 N. caerulea 
 (shown below) has violet-blue petals. 
  
 Violet blue petals and an upright habit make 'Regina' a standout among houseplants. 
  
 Keep in mind Neomarica is tropical. This South American native 
 thrives in bright locations, shaded from direct sun. Keep it warm, too, year-round. 
 Repot in spring 
 , only when the plant gets too crowded. It thrives in a small container and 
 blooms best when pot-bound. Just be sure to use one with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. 
 If you've never grown Walking Iris, give it a try. Growing it indoors is easy and soon you'll have lots of plantlet 
 "babies" to share with friends. 
  
 Walking Iris Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South America 
 Height: 
 2 ft (60 cm) or more, depending on the species 
 Light: 
  
 Bright, indirect light or partial sun. 
 Water: 
 Water generously throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room humidity (40-50% relative humidity). Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter, so it's a good idea to use a humidity gauge. Use a  
 cool-mist humidifier 
  to maintain humidity around this tropical plant. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C. Walking Iris is hardy in USDA Zones 9-11. 
 You can scoot your container outdoors for the summer, if you want -- just keep it in full shade outside. 
 Soil: 
 Rich, humusy potting mix amended with horticultural sand for good drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every two weeks in winter (December-January) with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Division of rhizomes or new plantlets

 Wax Begonia 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Begonia x semperflorens-cultorum 
 Few indoor plants bloom nearly non-stop like wax begonia. It's actually a tender perennial that will grow 
 and flower year-round indoors. Put your begonia in a bright, warm spot and you'll enjoy an ongoing show of 
 colorful, cheerful flowers. 
  
  
  
  
 The begonia family includes more than 1,000 species and 10,000 hybrids and cultivars. Ongoing hybridization improves 
 these beautiful flowering house plants. 
 Newer hybrids are more compact with more -- and bigger -- blooms than we've ever seen. 
 Many varieties are available with white and many shades of pink and red flowers. 
 When buying a new flowering plant, choose one that has good bud color and has just started to bloom. 
 You'll find these plants sold as wax begonia or bedding begonia. 
  
  
 Round, thick, waxy leaves give this beautiful flowering plant its common name. They're typically dark-green 
 and may be tinged with bronze. Some hybrids have burgundy leaves or are variegated with white. 
 These prolific bloomers stay small, so grow several in a large pot for big impact. Or place 
 a few small pots together. 
  
 Caring for Wax Begonia 
  
 Keep the soil moist. 
  Allowing it to dry out will leave it susceptible to disease. But you don't want soggy soil, either. 
 Overwatering your begonia will cause leaves to wilt and turn yellow. 
 Cut off any affected leaves as soon as you notice them. They're likely to rot and attract fungus. 
 The moist conditions begonias love make them prone to  
 powdery mildew 
  -- a powdery white fungus that appears on the foliage. 
 Spray an affected plant with a fungicide and keep it away from other plants to prevent it from spreading. 
 Shed some light. 
  Give your begonia plenty of bright light year-round. Plants that don't bloom aren't getting 
 enough sunlight. 
  
  
 Prune your plant. 
 Remove spent flowers to encourage more blooms. 
 Also cut back the foliage occasionally to keep it looking neat. 
 Raise the humidity. 
 Begonias will suffer in the dry air of a heated home in winter. Keep them away from 
 air vents and drafts. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, place your begonia on a tray of wet pebbles 
 or use a room humidifier. 
  
 Wax Begonia Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrids 
 Height: 
 6-12 in (15-30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright, indirect light. Begonias grow well under fluorescent lights, too. If you move your  
 begonia outdoors for the summer, keep it shaded from hot, direct sun. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil evenly moist all year. Overwatering will cause leaves to turn yellow. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 40-50% relative humidity around your begonias. Keep pot on a tray of wet pebbles to  
 increase humidity 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Cool nights (60°F/16°C) and warm days (65-75°F/18-24°C) will 
 trigger flower buds. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss based potting mix with added perlite for faster drainage. African violet potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 A steady diet of weak fertilizer will keep begonias happy. Feed monthly 
 with a high-phosphorus (10-20-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem cuttings in spring and root in fresh potting mix. Keep soil lightly 
 moist. Cover the whole container and plant with a plastic bag or cloche to hold in humidity. 
 Wax begonia seeds are tiny and slow to germinate. You can sow seeds in spring, but 
 it can take several months to grow.

 Wax Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Hoya carnosa 
 Long, slender vines of the Wax Plant are covered with thick, green leathery leaves. The 
 leaves are sometimes flecked with silvery or creamy white. 
  
  
  
 To show off its thickly-leafed vines, and to give them a denser appearance, loop them 
 around a wire hoop or  
 small trellis 
  
 and tie loosely with florists wire. 
  
  
 Given enough light, Wax Plant will produce parachute clusters of star-shaped, white to pink flowers with 
 five-point centers. Those flowers are so intricately detailed, uniformly shaped and shiny, they're sometimes called Porcelain Flower. 
 You can expect Hoyas to bloom in the spring, summer or fall, depending on the variety. 
 You'll find lots of 
 H. carnosa 
 cultivars for sale. 'Krinkle' has wrinkly leaves... 
 'Variegata' features leaves edged in creamy white... and 'Krimson Queen'. 
 Other species of 
 Hoya 
 are available, but they don't produce the number and size of flowers as the 
 carnosa 
 species. 
 H. bella 
 is a small-leafed species. 
 H. australis 
 has smaller flowers that smell like honeysuckle. 
 Sticky flowers? 
 Hoya flowers are sweetly scented and may form drops of sticky nectar. This is normal. 
  
 Late Bloomer 
  
 Give this plant time to adjust when you bring it home. You may not see many blooms on it until it is 2 or 3 years old, so don't give up on it. 
  
  
 Dropped flower buds 
 are often caused by soil that is too dry or too wet. Also, do not move the plant when 
 buds are forming because changes in light may cause them to drop. Raising the humidity can help. 
 Repot in early spring 
 every 2-3 years or when it outgrows its pot. Wax Plant blooms best when almost pot 
 -bound, 
 so move it to a slightly larger pot (about 2 inches (5 cm) larger than the old one). 
 Never 
 repot a plant when it's 
 in bloom because it may drop its flower buds. 
  
  
 Hoya carnosa 
 is a fast-grower. You can  
 prune back long vines 
 if you want to keep it compact. The best 
 time to prune is early spring, before Hoyas start their most vigorous time of growth.  
 Don't prune off the leafless stem 
 -- or spur -- where flowers have been produced because flowers will form on the same spurs year after year. 
 Wax Plant belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae -- the milkweed family. When cut, the stems may exude (just a little) milky, white sap. 
 Watch for pests. 
 Peaty potting mixes that are kept wet sometimes attract  
 fungus gnats 
 . 
 You may find these fly-like critters crawling on the soil.  
 Mealybugs 
  
 may move in, too. Easy to detect, they are small, white and fuzzy. 
 Spider mites 
  are less common, but can cause more 
 damage. Fine webbing between stems are a sure sign of this destructive pest. Cut off badly affected stems. If it's warm 
 enough, take your plant outdoors (keep it shaded outside) and wash it off with tepid water to dislodge these mites.  
 Otherwise, place it in the shower. Treat it with insecticide specially made for spider mites. 
  
 Misting your plant regularly may prevent an invasion of spider mites that like dry air. 
 And your Wax Plant 
 will love the humidity 
 . 
 Winter care. 
 Hoyas do not go dormant in the winter, but growth slows down with lower light levels. One of the few 
 problems with Hoya plant care is overwatering. Allow soil to dry out a bit between waterings in winter and stop 
 fertilizing until spring. Maintain humidity, which can drop drastically in winter. Also keep your plant away from 
 heat/AC vents. Blasts of hot air, especially, will dry out foliage and may cause flower buds to drop. 
 This is a long-lived plant and easy to grow with little attention. 
  
 Growing Wax Plant Indoors 
  
  
 Origin: 
  India and East Asia 
 Height: 
  Trailing stems can grow to 10 ft (3 m) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light year-round. Some direct sun is fine, but shade plants from harsh summer sun, which 
 can scorch foliage. Hoyas will live in low light, but will not bloom.  
 Artificial grow lights 
   
 work beautifully. Put your Wax plant about 8 inches (20 cm) beneath the light and keep the lights on for about 
 14 hours a day. It's also important to give them darkness at night. Plants need a rest, too. 
 Once your plant has formed flower buds, don't move it around. Changes in light levels can cause flower buds to shrivel up 
 or fall off before they open. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly spring through fall, allowing potting mix to dry out a bit between waterings. 
 Flowering Hoya plants are thirsty, but don't like to sit in soggy soil. Be sure to use a pot with drainage holes and 
 empty the drainage tray. Use room-temperature water for your tropical plants. Cold water can shock them. In winter, 
 water sparingly 
 giving the plant just enough to keep the soil from drying out completely. 
 Humidity: 
 Prefers 50% relative humidity. 
 Use a  
 cool-mist room humidifier 
  for best results. Or you can set the pot on a humidity tray. 
 Misting the foliage with a fine spray of room-temperature water helps, but avoid getting the flowers wet. 
 Temperature: 
 Keep it warm year-round (65-75°F/18-24°C), with a minimum temperature of 60°F/16°C. 
 Soil: 
  2 parts sphagnum peat moss-based potting mix with 1 part perlite added for better drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with high-potassium liquid 
 fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (7 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring. Cuttings should include at least 1 pair of leaves. They 
 will root easily in moist potting mix.

 Aloe Vera Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Aloe barbadensis 
 Aloe vera plant is known for the healing properties of its sap. 
 Also called Burn Plant or Medicine Plant, 
 m 
 any people 
 use the gel-like liquid from a broken leaf to soothe minor burns and abrasions. 
 Sap from a snapped-off leaf has restorative properties that can be applied directly to skin. 
 Aloe vera plant's sap is commonly used in medicines, lotions and cosmetics around the world. 
  
  
  
  
 Aloe vera plants are hardy, slow-growing succulents that grow in rosettes of plump, upward-curving green leaves. 
 Aloe vera leaves are faintly spotted and edged with soft teeth. 
 Plants grown outdoors often bloom in spring with yellow, tubular flowers carried on tall flower spikes. 
 However, it rarely blooms indoors. 
 Aloe is easy to grow and fairly trouble-free. So efficient at storing water, it rarely needs a drink. Are you a forgetful waterer? If so, this succulent is an ideal houseplant for you. 
 It's long-lived, too. Give it plenty of sunlight, and you'll enjoy it for years. Want more? Aloe vera readily grows offsets that can be separated for more plants. 
  
 Aloe Vera Plant Care Problems and Solutions 
  
 Don't let it burn. 
   
 If you move your plant outdoors for the summer, make the move a gradual one. Ironically, aloe vera plant sunburns easily if it is 
 suddenly exposed to full sun, which shows as  
 brown or gray scorched spots  
 on leaves. 
 Watch for pests. 
  Check your aloe vera plant once in a while for scale insects and mealybugs that may infest this plant. 
 Treat any infestation for these  
 house plant pests 
  immediately. 
 Repot crowded plants. 
  Repot young plants in spring when they are outgrowing their pots. These types 
 of succulents freely produces offsets. You can keep plants from getting overcrowded by propagating offsets as 
 they begin to form rosettes. 
  
 What type of pot? 
  
 Terra cotta is ideal for succulents because it is porous, allowing the potting mix to dry out faster. These easy-to-find pots also have drainage holes -- a must for succulent plants, which are prone to rot if their roots stay soaking wet. 
  
  
 Brown leaf tips 
 on aloe vera plant usually indicate that it's not getting enough water. 
 Water the plant thoroughly and allow the excess water to drain. 
 Black spots 
 on leaves are often due to overwatering. Do not allow water to collect in the rosettes of leaves, which 
 causes the plant to rot. 
  
  
 Buy Aloe Vera Plant 
  
 You'll find aloe vera plants for sale under the common name or scientific name, Aloe barbadensis. This popular succulent is easy to find in many garden centers year-round and online. 
  
 Aloe Vera Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Northeast Africa 
 Height: 
  1-2 ft (30-60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, with some direct sun in winter. Keep aloe vera out of hot, direct sunlight in summer, which can scorch its leaves. It's a good idea to rotate your plant each week to expose all sides to sunlight for even growth. 
 Water: 
  Spring through fall, water thoroughly, allowing the potting medium to almost dry out before watering again. Don't allow water to settle in the rosette of leaves because they easily rot. Water sparingly in winter when growth is slower. Do not allow the soil to dry out completely, however. When aloe vera is too dry the leaves will wrinkle. 
 Humidity: 
  Average (around 40% relative humidity) to dry room humidity. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C) year-round. If you move aloe vera outdoors for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. 
 Soil: 
  Cactus potting mix is ideal because it is fast-draining. Or add 1 part horticultural sand with 2 parts all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Spring through fall, feed monthly with a 2-7-7 succulent plant fertilizer. Stop feeding in winter when growth is slow. 
 Propagation: 
  Cut off new offsets in spring or early summer. Allow the cut portion to dry for a day or two to prevent the sap from oozing, then pot it in barely moist sandy potting mix.

 Blue Agave Plants 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Agave parryi 
  
 Blue agave plants make good house plants as long as you can provide the sunlight they need. 
 These round succulent plants grow in a rosette of thick, spined leaves. 
 Take care when handling them -- 
 those spines are sharp! It's a good idea to display it where it won't get touched or accidentally bumped. 
  
  
  
  
 Give these succulents as much light throughout the year as possible. Moving your agave plant outdoors 
 for the summer may be ideal, if it's sheltered from rain. It can withstand high temperatures and around 5 
 hours of direct sunlight each day. It loves bright light in the 
 winter months, too. However, it won't tolerate cold temperatures, so bring it back in before the nighttime 
 temperatures drop to 50°F/10°C. 
 Keeping agaves indoors year-round is fine. Just put your plant in front of a sunny window. 
 If you move your agave plant outside, make the move 
 to full sun a gradual one. Succulents need to be acclimated to intense light levels. Likewise, when 
 you bring it back indoors in the fall, let it slowly become accustomed to lower light levels. 
 Some people wonder if blue agave is a cactus because it has spines. It's a succulent, but not a cactus. 
 Cacti are distinguishable from other succulents because they have  
 aeroles 
  -- the raised or 
 sunken place where spines or flowers emerge. 
 Blue agave plants are slow-growing, so they rarely need repotted. Repot only every 5 years or so -- just to 
 freshen the soil. Use a wide, heavy pot to prevent toppling. 
  
 Growing Tips for Blue Agave Plants 
  
 Origin: 
  Southwestern U.S. and Mexico 
 Height: 
 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly in spring and summer, allowing the top half of the soil to dry out 
 between waterings. 
 Agaves are drought-tolerant because they store water. 
 Overwatering in the winter is the most common reason for succulents to fail. 
 Water sparingly in fall and winter 
 when growth is slower, but do not allow soil to dry out completely. 
 Never water the center of the rosette because this plant will easily rot. 
 Water from the bottom or water the potting mix. 
 Remember to always use room-temperature water when watering your plants. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity); dry air isn't a problem with this desert native. 
 Temperature: 
 Spring to fall, keep warm (70-90°F/21-32°C). In winter, cool 
 (50-60°F/10-16°C). 
 Soil: 
 Well-draining potting mix, such as cactus mix. Or mix 2 parts all-purpose potting mix with 
 1 part horticultural sand. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in spring and summer with a liquid 
 fertilizer specially made for succulents, diluted by half. Don't feed in fall and winter, when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
 Remove offsets that grow at the base of the plant. Cut them off when they are 2-4 in 
 (5-10 cm) high and pot them separately.

 Cactus House Plants 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Cactaceae 
 family 
 Cactus house plants are easy to grow and vary widely in size and shape. 
 There are hundreds of different kinds of desert cacti, all of which are succulents. A cactus is distinguishable 
 from other succulents by areoles, the small sunken or raised spots from which spines and flowers emerge. 
  
  
  
  
 The golden barrel cactus ( 
 Echinocactus grusonii 
 ), shown at left, is one of the most popular cactus house plants. 
 This globe-shaped cactus is slow-growing, but can grow to 3 ft (90 cm) in diameter. Its prominent ribs are covered top 
 to bottom with yellow spines that can reach up to 2 in (5 cm) long. 
 You can expect this cactus to produce bell-shaped yellow flowers in the summer. 
  
 Flowering Cactus Plants 
  
  
  
  
 Gynmocalycium quelianum is slow-growing, but the beautiful white blooms are worth the wait. 
  
  
  
  
 Coryphantha andreae typically 
 will not flower until it is several years old. Then it produces 
 big, shiny, daisy-like flowers in spring and summer. 
  
  
  
  
 Aylostera kupperiana has big, fiery orange-red flowers. Put it in a sunny window and you'll 
 enjoy a succession of blooms for several weeks. 
  
  
  
  
 All desert cacti love to bask in the sun. A south-facing window is ideal for cactus house plants. Most of them will flower 
 if given enough sunshine, although some types of cactus will bloom only when they are a few years old. 
 Repot in spring when the roots have filled the pot. Move the cactus to a pot only 1 size bigger. A pot that's 
 too big will hold too much water in the soil, which can cause root rot. It's a good idea to use a terra cotta pot 
 because the porous material helps the soil to dry out faster. 
  
 Cactus Plants for Sale 
  
  
  
 Caring for Cactus House Plants 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southwestern U.S., Mexico and South America 
 Height: 
  Varies by species 
 Light: 
 At least 2-3 hours of full sun a day. 
 Water: 
 Water regularly spring through fall while plant is growing, sparingly in winter. If the plant 
 appears shriveled and wrinkled, it's underwatered. To rehydrate it, water lightly, and then again the following day, 
 and it will recover nicely. Be careful not to drench the soil. Cactus is likely to rot if its roots become soaking wet. 
 Tap water is hard on cactus plants and can cause hard water stains. 
 Use distilled or rain water and 
 water from the bottom or water the potting mix. 
 Humidity: 
 Average (around 30-40% relative humidity) to dry air. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. In winter, a cooler place to rest -- 50-60°F/10-16°C at night is ideal. 
 Soil: 
 Use a potting mix that drains well. You can buy a mix specially made for cacti, or use 2 parts 
 all-purpose potting mix with 1 part sharp sand or perlite. Adding about a 1/2-inch layer of pebbles to the bottom of the 
 container will help drainage and also add weight to the bottom. (Large cacti can become top-heavy). 
 Fertilizer: 
 Typical cactus house plant fertilizer 
 is 2-7-7. It needs less nitrogen than foliage plants and 
 higher phosphorus and potassium for better flowering and strong roots. 
 Propagation: 
 Many cacti grow offsets at the base of the parent plant. Cut them away with a sharp knife. 
 Allow the cut surface to dry for a couple days so it doesn't ooze sap and to prevent the new plant from rotting. Place 
 offsets on the surface of moist, sandy potting mixture. Keep new offsets in a warm, bright place, but out of direct 
 sun for the first month. The best season to propagate is late spring or early summer, when plants are beginning their 
 most active period of growth.

 Christmas Cactus Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Schlumbergera bridgesii 
 Good Christmas cactus care will bring a show of beautiful winter blooms year after year. 
 This tropical cactus does not exist in the wild. It is a hybrid of 
 Schlumbergera truncata  
 and  
 Schlumbergera russelliana 
 that grow as 
 epiphytes 
 in the rain forests of South America, making 
 their home on tree branches. ( 
 Epiphyte 
 comes from the Greek words 
 epi 
 meaning upon and 
 phyton 
 meaning plant.) 
  
  
  
 Christmas Cactus is a stellar performer with gorgeous blooms in time for the holidays. 
  
 Schlumbergera bridgesii 
 has dark-green flattened stems composed of segments joined in a scalloped pattern. Flowers 
 appear at the tips of the stems, about 2 in (5 cm) long. The flowers have 
 stamens protruding from the 
 back-swept petals, available 
 in shades of pink, red, purple, yellow and white 
 . 
 More than 200 cultivars exist. 
  
 'Christmas Flame' 
 is golden yellow... 
 'Lavender Beauty' 
 is purple and white... 
 and snowy 
 'White Christmas' 
 are just a few. With so many captivating colors to choose from, why buy just one? 
 Newer cultivars bring together 
 two colors, offering some exciting new combinations. 
  
 Year-Round Christmas Cactus Care 
  
 What to Do After Flowering 
  
 After putting on a big show of blooms for the holiday season, this beauty needs a rest. When the flowering has stopped, 
 water sparingly and stop 
 fertilizing for about two months. Keep up the humidity. You can resume normal care 
 when you see new growth, beginning in spring. 
  
 How to Prune and Propagate Christmas Cactus Cuttings 
  
 Wondering whether to prune? It's not mandatory, but this tropical cactus will eventually get "leggy" if you let it grow.  
 Regular pruning will encourage the plant to branch out where the stem was cut, creating a fuller plant. Because flowers grow at the ends of the stems, you'll also get more flowers this way. Spring is the 
 best time to prune it back, when it begins actively growing again. 
  
 Pruning Tip: 
  Use sharp, clean pruning shears to prevent tearing the stems. Cut a stem off between segments (the place where they're joined together by a midrib). 
  
  
 Don't toss out those stem cuttings! Propagate them for more plants. See "Propagation" below. 
  
 Christmas cactus care throughout the year will ensure an abundance of winter flowers. 
  
 How to Get Christmas Cactus to Bloom Again 
  
 Schlumbergera bridgesii  
 is often coaxed into bloom by greenhouse growers to sell before the holidays. 
 You can expect an abundance of colorful winter flowers every year without any special treatment, but 
 they'll probably appear later in the season than when you bought your plant. 
 Want to coax it early? I thought so. There are a few things you should do to make it bloom before the holidays. 
 Shorter, cooler days and nights for about 8-10 weeks are needed for the plant to set buds. Moving it outdoors in fall is ideal, just keep it out of direct sun. Bring the plant back inside before the first frost. 
 Keep soil barely moist, but not too dry. Shriveled, limp stems are a sign that it's too dry. 
 After you bring your plant indoors, keep it in a room that stays completely dark after sunset, giving the plant total darkness for 12-14 hours a night. Cover the cactus with a box or bag, if needed for this dark period each night. 
 Once it starts budding, move your plant to a location where you want to display it for the season, and keep it there. Changes in light and temperature by moving it around will cause it to drop its buds and flowers. Also keep it away from drafty areas like doorways and heat vents. 
  
 Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Dropped blooms? 
  This holiday cactus will drop its flower buds when it's stressed from dry soil, low light, blasts of cold air from doorways or repotting while it's in bloom. Once buds set, don't move your plant around. Changes in light and temperature (besides nightly fluctuations) may cause blooms to fall off. 
 Wondering when to repot? 
  
 Repotting Christmas cactus is usually only necessary every 2 to 3 years. 
 Christmas cactus 
 prefers to be slightly pot-bound and blooms best this way. 
 Wait till spring or early summer to repot -- never while it's budding and blooming, which can cause them to drop. 
 Use a heavy pot to balance the weight of an older, larger plant. Long stems can topple a lightweight pot. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, slip it into a 
 cachepot 
 -- a decorative container without drainage holes. 
 Wrinkled, drooping stems 
  are typically a sign this plant is thirsty. Take care not to over-water, but don't allow the potting medium to dry out, either.  
 Yellow stems 
  indicate too much water. (See "Water" in the tips below.) 
 Is Christmas cactus poisonous? 
  No. While it's not a good idea to allow your pet to chew on houseplants, you don't have to worry about this one. It's safe for cats and dogs. 
  
 Christmas Cactus Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
 Hybrid 
 of 
 Schlumbergera truncata 
 and 
  
 Schlumbergera russelliana 
 , 
 native to the Brazilian rain forest 
 Height: 
 To 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Christmas cactus care includes lots of bright, indirect light. This tropical cactus doesn't like hot, direct sunlight because it will burn the foliage. Stems that turn purplish-red have been exposed to too much direct sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, then empty the drainage tray. Allow the surface of the soil to dry before watering again. One thing this cactus won't tolerate is soggy soil, which can lead to root rot and possibly stem rot. Soft, mushy, or yellow 
 stems are symptoms of over-watering. 
 Don't allow the potting medium to dry out either -- 
 stems will shrivel and wilt, and those buds and blooms may drop off, if gets too dry. After the flowering season is over, water sparingly until new 
 growth begins in spring. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain around 50% relative humidity near the plant. Indoor air can become extremely dry in the winter, so it's a good idea to use a humidity gauge, rather than guess. Keep tropical plants away from heat vents and fireplaces. Stand the pot on a dish of wet pebbles or use a cool-mist room humidifier, if needed. Check out these tips for  
 raising the humidity 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 To set flower buds, the plant needs cool 60-65°F/16-18°C days and 45-55°F/7-13°C nights. Once buds set, 
 70-75°F/21-24°C days and 60-70°F/16-21°C nights. 
 Soil: 
 Well-drained potting medium is essential. Mix 1 part peat moss-based potting mix and 1 part fine-grade fir bark. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a water-soluble fertilizer that includes micro-nutrients. Don't skip this -- regular feeding will give your plant more  
 oomph 
  for blooming. 
 Propagation: 
 Christmas cactus cuttings can be propagated for more plants. In spring, take stem cuttings of 2-3 segments. Allow the cut ends to dry for a day or two, then place cut end upright in moist perlite or peat moss-based mix.

 Crown of Thorns Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Euphorbia milii 
 Crown of Thorns plant is one of the rare succulents capable of blooming most of the year. It also happens to be one of the easiest to grow indoors, preferring the same warm conditions we do. 
 Bright-green leaves grow along its thick, thorny stems. Lower leaves naturally fall off as the plant ages -- and they won't grow back. If your 
 plant gets too tall and leggy, you can prune it back by half its size in spring. This will cause it to branch out. 
 New stems will grow from below where the pruning cuts were made, making this succulent bushy and full. 
  
  
  
  
 Its flowers are actually bracts that last for several weeks, with an ongoing show of color that lasts for months. Those bracts are available in bright pink, salmon, peach, red, white or yellow. 
 Today's hybrids produce more -- even bigger -- flowers than ever before. 
 Crown of Thorns flower dependably when they get enough light. 
  
 Spring and summer are usually the best seasons 
 for an abundance of blooms. However, you can keep this unusual succulent blooming through fall with plenty of bright light. 
 Give Crown of Thorns a winter rest. 
  Shorter daylight hours in fall will cause growth of the plant to slow down. Set your plant in a cooler spot (with sunlight) and water sparingly throughout the winter. (See "Temperature" and "Water" tips below.) 
 They're easy to grow and drought-tolerant, preferring 
 slightly dry, sandy soil. This succulent stores water in its thick stems just like a cactus, so it can be 
 watered less frequently than other house plants. If its leaves turn yellow and fall off, cut back on the watering. 
 CAUTION: Wear thick gloves when handling this plant -- those thorns are sharp! Also, watch out for its toxic, milky sap, 
 which can irritate your skin, eyes and mouth.

 Crown of Thorns Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 No flowers? 
 If you just brought it home from the nursery, give it time. Young plants probably won't bloom until they are at least a year old. Spring is the strongest season for flowering. This tough succulent doesn't need a lot of encouragement to bloom -- if it's not blooming, it's not getting enough sunlight. 
 Yellow leaves? 
  You over-watered. Those thick, succulent stems store water, allowing Crown of Thorns to go longer without a drink. Water less in the winter, while growth is slower. 
 Repot in spring 
 , probably every couple years or when it's crowded in its pot. Use a pot just 1-2 inches larger than the old one, with a drainage hole to prevent soggy medium and root rot. Keep the base of the plant at the soil level, just as it was in the old pot; don't bury the stems or they'll rot. Larger shrubs can be top-dressed instead by replacing the top couple inches of potting mix with fresh mix. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Watch for tiny insects around the growing tips.  
 Aphids 
  are attracted to new growth, sucking plant juices and excreting  
 honeydew 
  -- a sticky substance. Treat any infestation immediately because aphids cause damage to plants, multiply quickly, and may move on to your other houseplants. 
  
 Crown of Thorns Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar 
 Height: 
  2 ft (60 cm). Prune off growing tips to control plant's height. 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun. 
 Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. 
 Move Crown of Thorns to a sunny window where it gets about 4 hours 
 of direct sun every day. Give it a quarter turn every week to expose all sides to sunlight to promote even growth. Don't have a sunny window? 
 Set it under a 
  
 grow light 
 , if you want. 
 Water: 
  Allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. Water sparingly in winter when growth is slower. Also 
 avoid getting water on the leaves and stems because they can rot if they get too wet. Yellow leaves that fall off are a sign the plant is over-watered. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
   Grows best with average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C; a cooler winter rest (with a minimum of 55°F/13°C) will help promote flowers in spring and summer. If you move your plant outdoors for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. Crown of Thorns will tolerate temps up to 90°F/32°C. 
 Soil: 
  A fast-draining medium such as cactus potting mix 
 works best. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. Don't feed in winter, when flowering is over. 
 Propagation: 
 Propagating from tip cuttings is easy, if you don't stick your fingers with the sharp thorns! Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem cuttings in spring or summer. Dip the cut ends in warm water for a few minutes to stop the flow of sap then 
 allow to dry for 24 hours before inserting into barely moist potting mix. Cuttings will root in about 6 weeks.

 Cylindrical Snake Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Sansevieria cylindrica 
 Cylindrical Snake Plant is an African succulent that makes a carefree house plant. 
 Round leaves with a dark-green striped pattern give this eye-catching succulent its common name. Pointed leaf tips 
 give it another name, African Spear. (Watch out for those points -- they are sharp!) The gray-green tubular leaves grow in a 
 rosette and are about an inch thick. 
 Wipe leaves with a damp cloth to keep them dust-free. 
  
  
  
  
 Long, creamy white flower spikes may appear on mature plants. If you're lucky enough to get the blooms, you'll love 
 their beautiful fragrance. 
 This relative of 
 Mother-in-Law's Tongue 
  
 is just as easy to grow, but has a fresh, bold style all its own. You'll 
 enjoy this striking accent among your indoor plant collection. Its easy-going nature and tolerance of dry air and soil 
 also make it a reliable office plant. 
  
 Any problems with growing  
 Sansevieria 
  are usually related to watering. Allow the soil 
 to dry out between waterings. If in doubt, keep it on the dry side. The only things that will kill this 
 plant is soggy soil and prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. 
 Repot in spring, only when plants get crowded and need dividing. Keep the rosette of the leaves at soil level. 
 Use a wide, heavy container to prevent toppling -- this tall plant can get top-heavy. 
  
 Sansevieria Cylindrica Snake Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  Up to 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun. If you move  
 Sansevieria cylindrica 
  outdoors for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. But make the move into direct sunlight a gradual one to avoid scorching its leaves. Scorch marks look like gray or brown patches. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, then allow the potting mix to dry out before watering again. Don't water the center 
 of the rosette because the leaves will easily rot. 
 Water the soil, taking care not to get water on the leaves, 
 which will cause them to rot. If the leaves turn yellow, or get soft and mushy at their base, the plant is overwatered. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (about 40% relative humidity) or lower.  
 Snake Plants 
  will tolerate dry air, but keep it away from air vents or drafts. 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. It will tolerate fluctuating 
 temperatures, but not below 55°F/13°C. 
 Soil: 
  Cactus potting mix works best because it is fast-draining. This succulent will not tolerate soggy potting medium. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with fertilizer specially made for succulent plants, mixed at half the recommended strength. Don't feed in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
  Division. Propagate Snake Plant by separating the "pups" (offsets) that grow at the base of the 
 parent plant. Dividing them is easy. Turn the pot on its side, then ease out the plant. Use a serrated 
 knife to cut off the offsets and pot them up individually.

 Desert Rose Plant Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Adenium obesum 
 Desert rose plant is so easy to care for, it's a wonder why we don't see these beautiful succulents more often in 
 nurseries and florist's shops. 
  
  
  
  
 Desert rose branches naturally, creating an attractive treelike house plant. Its succulent stems are covered top to 
 bottom with long, evergreen leaves. 
 The desert rose flower is a sight to behold, and you'll enjoy them in abundance each summer. Clusters 
 of gorgeous pink or red flowers grow at the tips of the stems, with a succession of blooms that last for months. 
 Put this desert beauty in a sunny window year-round and pot it in a sandy, well-draining mix (cactus potting mix is ideal). 
 It doesn't take much attention to keep desert rose plant happy and blooming. 
  
 Drought-tolerant, this is one of the easiest succulents to grow, and one of the showiest, too. 
  
 Water with care. 
  This flowering succulent stores water in its swollen base, 
 so it doesn't need watered often. In fact, it will not tolerate overwatering. Take care to water the potting medium only. Don't 
 get water on the base of the plant because it will rot and may not recover. 
 Shed some light. 
  
 Give your desert rose as much light as you can. 
 You can move it out to the patio for the summer, if you want. It can take the 
 summer sun and heat. Just be sure to bring it in before the temperature drops to 50°F/10°C. 
  
  
 Dropped leaves. 
  This South-African succulent shrub may drop its leaves and go dormant in the winter. Lack of light, 
 dry soil or cold temperatures will often cause dormancy. Don't worry -- it'll regrow leaves when it gets what it wants. 
 Don't overpot. 
  It flowers best when slightly pot-bound. It's slow-growing and rarely needs repotted anyway. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy potting medium. 
 Is desert rose poisonous? 
  Yes. Handle desert rose with care -- its sap is toxic. Keep it away from children, cats and dogs. 
 Many beautiful hybrids are available to choose from. Desert rose flowers range from soft pink to deep red, purple or 
 white, or a variety of combinations. 
  
 Desert Rose Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  East Africa 
 Height: 
  3 ft (90 cm); desert rose bonsai grows to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light to direct sunlight. 
 Water: 
   Aim to keep the medium only lightly moist -- this plant won't tolerate overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room humidity (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. If you put your plant outdoors for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. Bring it back indoors when nighttime temperatures drop in autumn; it will tolerate a low of 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
  Fast-draining mix, such as cactus potting mix. Or mix equal parts peat moss and sharp sand. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. 
 Propagation:

 Donkey's Tail 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Sedum morganianum 
 Donkey's Tail -- sometimes called Burro's Tail -- is a succulent with stems thickly covered with overlapping, plump, 
 blue-green leaves that trail down the side of its container. 
  
  
  
  
 Although it rarely blooms indoors, succulent flowers of pink or red may appear at the tips of its stems in the summer. 
 Give your succulent house plant bright light in the growing season, spring through fall. Bright light 
 in the summer and a cool rest in the winter will help promote blooming. 
 Shed some light. 
 Give this evergreen succulent plenty of bright light. If you move it outside in summer, put it in a shaded spot 
 because it sunburns easily if suddenly exposed to full sun. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
  Keep  
 Sedum morganianum 
  slightly cooler in winter, with a minimum of 55°F/13°C. Stop 
 fertilizing in fall and winter and water sparingly during this rest. 
 Repot in spring 
  when the plant fills the pot. You can use a shallow pot -- its roots aren't deep. Move to a 
 pot only 1 size larger, with drainage holes to prevent overwatering. 
 Handle with care. 
  This plant is so fragile that its leaves will fall off at the slightest touch. It's a good 
 idea to pot it in a hanging basket and leave it alone except for watering and fertilizing. 
  
 Donkey's Tail for Sale 
  
 You'll usually find these succulents for sale under the Sedum morganianum name. 
 One cultivar  
 'Burrito' 
  is smaller than the species, with short stems. It has one big advantage, 
 though -- it's not quite as fragile. 
  
  
  
 Donkey's Tail Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico 
 Height: 
  Trailing to 3 ft (90 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light with some direct sun. Shade from strong summer sun. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist in spring and summer. 
 Take care not to saturate the soil when watering Donkey's Tail. Soggy soil will cause the stems to rot at the base. 
 In fall and winter, water sparingly. If leaves appear shriveled, it may be underwatered. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Will tolerate dry air, but keep plant out of drafts and away from AC/heat vents. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. Give it a cool rest in the winter to promote 
 blooming 55-60°F/13-16°C. 
 Soil: 
 Cactus potting mix works best because it is fast-draining. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring and summer with a fertilizer specially made for succulents. 
 Propagation: 
  Succulent cuttings. Take 2-3 in (5-7 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring. Remove the lower leaves to expose the stem and insert it in a mixture 
 of half sharp sand and half peat moss. Keep it moist and be patient -- it can take a couple months. You can also grow from 
 leaf cuttings following the same method.

 Easter Cactus 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Hatiora gaertneri 
 Easter cactus is a member of the Cactaceae family. Native to the South American rain forests, 
 this cactus is  
 epiphytic 
 , making its home on trees. 
 It holds onto tree branches with its 
 thick, aerial roots.

 Its stems are made up of flat, narrow segments connected by a midrib. You can distinguish it from other holiday cactus 
 because its stem segments are not scalloped or toothed, and by its starburst-shaped blooms. 
 The biggest difference is its bloom time. You can expect an abundance of flowers in spring -- typically April or May -- 
 that last about a month. Varieties are available in shades of pink, white, orange and red. 
 Display flowering Easter cactus in a hanging basket or set it on a  
 plant stand 
  to show off its colorful blooms. 
  
 How to Get Easter Cactus to Bloom 
  
 Coax blooms. 
  Blooming results from 8-10 weeks of shorter, cooler days. Check the temperature requirements below. Give the cactus 
 14-hour nights. Put a paper bag or box over it if you need to block out sunlight. Once buds set, don't move the cactus around. 
 Flower buds are likely to drop off if the budding plant is suddenly exposed to temperature or light changes. 
 Give it a rest. 
 After flowering, this South-American succulent needs a one-month rest. Water sparingly during this time and do not fertilize. Mist the plant 
 every day if needed to keep up the humidity. After this rest, you can resume regular watering and fertilizing. 
 Good year-round Easter cactus care will bring a show of flowers year after year. 
  
 You'll find Easter Cactus for sale in a range of colors, including pink. 
  
 Questions, Problems and Solutions for Easter Cactus 
  
 Wondering when to repot? 
  You can repot in late spring or early summer, after the one-month rest is over. Your cactus only needs repotted when it outgrows its container, probably every 2 or 3 years. Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil, a clay pot is ideal because it allows the potting medium to dry out faster. 
 Wrinkled, limp stems 
  are a sign the plant is too dry. Water thoroughly, then allow the top of the soil to dry out between waterings. 
 Yellow stems 
  indicate too much water. 
 Broken stems? 
  Those trailing stems are somewhat brittle and can break off between segments. It's a good idea to keep your plant where it won't be brushed against.  
 Don't toss out those stem pieces 
  -- you can grow new plants from them. (See "Propagation" below.) 
 To prune...or not to prune? 
  It's not necessary. Stems will branch out naturally, so you don't need to cut them unless you want to prevent your cactus from getting "leggy." Wait till summer, after the one-month rest. Use sharp, clean pruners to cut between stem segments. 
  
 Easter Cactus Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
 Brazil 
 Height: 
 12-24 in (30-60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy while plant is growing. After flowering is finished, water sparingly for 
 a month while the plant rests. Stems will shrivel or wilt if the roots are too dry. Yellow stems indicate overwatering. 
 Humidity: 
 Try to maintain 50% relative humidity or higher. Use a cool-mist room humidifier or stand the pot on a tray of wet pebbles. 
 Check out these 
 tips for  
 raising the humidity 
  for your house plants. 
 Temperature: 
 To set flower buds, the plant needs cool 60-65°F/16-18°C days and 45-55°F/7-13°C nights. Once buds set, 
 70-75°F/21-24°C days and 60-70°F/16-21°C nights. 
 Soil: 
 Mix 1 part potting soil and 1 part fine-grade fir bark. Good drainage is essential. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer when watering. When flowering season is over, stop 
 fertilizing for a month while plant is resting, then resume normal care. 
 Propagation: 
 Take stem cuttings with 1-4 segments in summer. Allow the cut ends to dry for a couple days before inserting upright in moist 
 perlite. They'll root in about 3-4 weeks.

 Echeveria Care Tips 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Echeveria 
 species 
 This is a desert succulent from the Crassulaceae family. 
 It's sometimes called Hen and Chicks, although several species go by this common name and it can be difficult 
 to tell these succulent plants apart. 
 All echeverias grow in a rosette 2-6 inches (5-15 cm) across on short stems. The rosette has fleshy, blue-green leaves that become tinged with red when exposed to sun. Handle it with care because the leaves break off easily. 
  
  
  
 Grow new plants. Just set leaves on moist potting medium -- they'll root easily. 
  
 Echeveria fimbriata 
 (shown above) has an upright, rosette form with leaves that often turn purplish-green. You can expect 
 it to bloom in late summer with red and orange flowers. 
  
  
 E. elegans 
  (pictured at right) is a popular species. It has a beautiful rosette form with 
 tall spikes of bell-shaped blooms on pink stems appearing in summer. 
 Pinch them off when flowers have faded. 
 Countless varieties are available to choose from. Choose any you like -- they're all easy to grow. 
  
  
 Several species look spectacular in a  
 dish garden 
  growing together, or combined with other succulents. 
 
Trying to identify echeveria? 
  Start with this  
 echeveria list 
  
of pictures with species names. You'll discover lots of information about these beautiful plants, too. 
 This is a plant that grows quickly. In fact, this succulent house plant produces offsets -- called chicks -- in abundance. If they get too crowded in their pot, cut them off and propagate them. 
 Give it a rest in winter. Cut back on water and provide cooler temperatures -- a cool, sunny room is ideal. 
  
 Echeveria Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Southwestern U.S. and Mexico 
 Height: 
 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light with some direct sun. 
 You can move this sun-loving succulent outdoors for the summer, 
 be sure to bring it back indoors when nighttime temperatures drop to 55°F/13°C; it's not cold-hardy. 
 Water: 
 Keep the mix lightly moist spring through fall and water sparingly in winter. Water the potting 
 mix and not the rosette because it can easily rot. Wrinkled leaves indicate this succulent plant needs more water. 
 Humidity: 
 Average to dry room humidity (40% relative humidity or lower). 
 Temperature: 
 In spring and summer, average to warm 65-80°F/18-27°C. Slightly cooler in fall and winter 
 55-75°F/13-24°C. 
 Soil: 
 Cactus potting mix, or equal parts horticultural sand with all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a 2-7-7 liquid fertilizer 
 diluted by 
 half. 
 Propagation: 
 Offsets can be cut off and potted in their own containers. Leaf cuttings can be propagated in spring 
 and summer. Allow leaf to dry for 24 hours to stop the oozing of its sap. Push the cut end into moist potting mix. Do not 
 cover the pot with plastic because succulents are likely to rot with excessive moisture.

 Flaming Katy 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Kalanchoe blossfeldiana 
 Flaming Katy is one of the few succulents grown just for its blooms. Bright clusters of tiny red, orange, 
 yellow, white, purple or pink flowers last several weeks. 
 Flowers may be single or double. 
  
  
  
 Give Kalanchoe plant lots of sunshine to make it bloom. Image by  
 Tinix 
  
 Kalanchoe plant has glossy, green leaves with scalloped edges that can become red-tinged when 
 exposed to full sun. 
 Although the thick leaves seem sturdy, they are actually quite brittle. Handle flaming katy 
 with care because the leaf tips easily break off. 
 When you're buying a Kalanchoe plant, choose one with bright, fresh-looking leaves and plenty of unopened buds -- sure signs of a healthy plant. 
  
 Kalanchoe care is easy -- providing you can give 
 Kalanchoe blossfeldiana 
 plenty of sunlight and the right amount of water. 
 Resist the temptation to overwater Kalanchoe. Like other succulent plants, it stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves and can suffer from root rot if it is overwatered. 
  
 Caring for Kalanchoe Plant - Problems and Solutions 
  
 Deadhead spent blooms. 
  You'll get the most flowers by deadheading during the flowering season. Cut off flower stems after the 
 blooms have faded to encourage more blooms. Cut them at the base of the plant 
 to keep the plant looking its best. 
 Wondering whether to repot...or not? 
 It's not necessary. Never repot a plant while it's blooming because it stresses the plant and may cause its flowers and flower buds to fall off. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, just slip it into a  
 cachepot 
  -- a decorative pot without drainage holes. It's a good idea to put small rocks in the bottom of the cachepot to keep the inner pot above drainage water. 
 Wilted leaves? 
 You overwatered. If you've been watering regularly and the leaves are soft and limp, the plant is likely suffering from root rot. Slip the plant out of the pot and take a peek at its roots. Are they soft and mushy? If so, you can toss out the plant -- it likely won't recover. If flaming katy is wilting for no apparent reason, it may be infested with root mealybugs. (See "Something bugging your plant?" below). 
 Yellow, wrinkled leaves 
  are caused by dry soil. Cut off any affected leaves. Water thoroughly to ensure all roots are moistened, then empty drainage tray. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Few pests bother flaming katy.  
 Mealybugs 
  are the most common  
 invaders. Watch for white, fuzzy patches near the leaf axils and under the leaves. Root mealybugs could be the cause of a 
 wilted plant. Ease the plant out of its pot and inspect the roots for these pests. Treat any infestation as soon as you see them to prevent pests from invading your other indoor plants. If it's badly infested, get rid of it. It's easier to replace your plant. 
  
 Flower Power! Hybrids can produce several clusters of up to 50 small, long-lasting flowers. 
  
 Although this compact, little house plant is easy to grow, getting it to re-bloom can be a challenge. 
  
 How to Get Kalanchoe Plant to Bloom Again 
  
 Long, sunny days followed by shorter hours of daylight are needed to set flower buds. 
 If you move the plant outside for the summer, keep it in the shade. Morning sun is fine. 
 Beginning in early October, keep the plant in a dark room for 14 hours each night for 2 weeks, and give it moderate light during the day. 
 Water it minimally and don't fertilize during this time. Shriveled, yellow leaves are a sign that it's too dry. 
 Flower buds will appear in about 6-8 weeks. Then you can resume with normal care. Flowering may be erratic, but the foliage will still be attractive. 
  
 Flaming Katy Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar 
 Height: 
  8-15 inches (20-38 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun. 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil mix barely moist. 
 Take care not to overwater Kalanchoe, which will cause leaves to wilt and may lead to root rot. 
 Use a pot with drainage holes; water thoroughly, then allow the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil to dry 
 out before watering. 
 Don't allow the soil to dry out completely, however. Dry soil will cause 
 the leaves to shrivel and turn yellow. 
 Water sparingly after it stops flowering. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40-50% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C 
 Soil: 
  2 parts all-purpose potting mix and 1 part horticultural sand or perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly from late spring to early fall with balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take stem cuttings in late spring.

 Gasteria Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Gasteria 
 sp. 
 This unusual succulent is often overlooked as a houseplant, but I think it's growing in popularity. It not only makes an eye-catching room accent, care for this plant is super-easy. 
 Set your plant in a semi-sunny location and leave it there. Its thick, succulent leaves retain water, so it rarely needs watering.

 Gasteria 
  sp. are in the Lily family, along with Haworthias and Aloes. Most share a similar growth habit, growing into a stemless rosette of leaves. 
 Leaves are thick, with rounded ends, and may have an upright growth habit, arching outward in a rosette, or fan shaped. Some varieties have a smooth surface and many have a pebbly texture. You can see from the picture here where it gets the common name, Ox Tongue. 
 Colors vary from dark green to lighter green, depending on the variety. Some are spotted with light shades of green or gray-green.  
 Gasteria bicolor 
  features thick, flat leaves with striped patterns. 
 Mature plants may send up flower spikes covered with small, bulbous blooms. Those flowers are stomach-shaped, rounded in the middle and tapered on one end. Its resemblance to a stomach is where this plant gets its genus name,  
 Gasteria 
 . 
  
 Problems and Solutions 
  
 Black spot 
  is a fungus that may be caused by overwatering. You'll recognize it as large, black indentations surrounded by yellow halos. Fungus won't kill your plant, but you'll want to treat it with a fungicide specially made for black spot. 
 White fuzzy specks, called  
 mealybugs 
  sometimes attack succulent plants. It's a good idea to look over houseplants for pests once in a while. Treat any infestation immediately to prevent bugs from moving on to your other indoor plants. 
  
 Gasteria Plant Care 
  
 Origin: 
 South Africa 
 Height: 
 Up to 1 ft (30 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright light, with some direct sun in winter. 
 Water: 
 Keep soil barely moist spring through fall, slightly drier in winter. Do not allow the potting medium to dry out completely. Water the potting medium, not the plant. 
 Avoid getting water on its leaves, which can cause them to rot. 
  
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity) suits this succulent. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm room temperatures (65-85°F/18-29°C). 
 Soil: 
 Cactus potting mix. Or add 1 part coarse sand with 2 parts all-purpose potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Spring through fall, feed monthly with a 2-7-7 succulent plant fertilizer, diluted by half. Gasteria sp. are slow-growing and won't need much plant food. 
 Propagation: 
 Divide offsets in spring or early summer. Ease the plants out of the pot, then gently pull the offset plants away. 
 Gasterias 
  
 have small roots, making them easy to separate. 
 Pot them in barely moist sandy potting mix.

 Haworthia Care Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Haworthia 
  species 
 If you like small house plants, you'll want to add at least one of these succulents to your collection. This genus offers more than 
 80 species to choose from and they're all easy to grow. 
  
  
  
  
 About Haworthia Plants 
  
 This stemless succulent grows in a rosette of fleshy, upright green leaves with sharp, pointed tips. 
  The 
 markings vary by species and may be striped or spotted.  
 H. pumila 
  is a popular variety featuring pearly white "warts" on its leaves, giving this species the common name "Pearl Plant." 
 Haworthias are small, making them beautiful additions to  
 succulent and cactus dish gardens 
 . 
 Some species may flower. The blooms are small and grow in clusters on long stems. 
 What these succulent house plants have in common is a tolerance for neglect. Put them in indirect light and water 
 occasionally and you'll keep them happy for several years. 
  
 Haworthia Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Watch that water. 
 When watering, avoid getting the leaves wet. Like other succulents, its leaves are prone to rot. 
 Give it a winter rest. 
 Growth slows down in winter, when light levels are lower. Water less in winter and keep your plant slightly cooler. Stop feeding till spring. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
   
 Mealy bugs 
  are the most common pest on succulents and cacti. They are tiny, white and fuzzy, looking like specks of white cotton. Keep an eye out for these insects, which may be anywhere on the plant -- stems, leaves, and even around the roots. Treat any infestation immediately because they multiply quickly and may move on to your other houseplants. Pick them off the plant, if you can. Or use insecticidal soap. 
  
 Wondering When to Repot? 
  
 Repot in late spring. 
 It's a good idea to repot every year or two because they shed their old roots each spring, and giving them 
 fresh potting mix will keep the plants healthy. You'll probably want to propagate offsets at that time anyway. 
 Haworthias have small roots, so a shallow container will do. If you use a container without drainage holes, use it as a cachepot. Slip a plain nursery pot into the cachepot to cover it up. A 
 dd a 1-inch (2.5 cm) layer of pebbles at the bottom of the cachepot to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
  
 Haworthias are attractive additions to succulent dish gardens -- and beautiful all on their own, too. 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 Choose plants based on colors and forms you like. They're all easy to grow. 
 Want a variety? I knew that you would. Get several. These beautiful South African succulents are a quick way to start or add to your collection. 
  
  
  
 Haworthia Growing Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  3-6 inches (7.5-15 cm) tall depending on species. 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect light. Unlike most succulents, haworthias don't like direct sun, which can make the leaves shrivel or cause brown scorch marks. 
 If you move your plant outdoors for the summer months, make the move a gradual one and keep it shaded. 
 Water: 
 Allow soil to almost dry out between waterings. Try to avoid getting the leaves wet because they may rot. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Dry air won't hurt haworthia. 
 Temperature: 
  Normal room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C) spring through fall. In winter, allow plant to rest, keeping it 
 cooler (around 60°F/16°C) if possible. 
 Soil: 
 Cactus and succulent potting mix 
 works well to provide good drainage. Or combine 2 parts peat-moss based potting mix and 1 part horticultural sand. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly in spring and summer with a fertilizer specially made for succulents. 
 Don't feed in winter when growth is slow. 
 Propagation: 
  Remove offsets that grow around the plant in spring and pot in their own containers.

 How to Grow Hoya Kerrii Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Hoya Kerrii 
 This heart-shaped succulent is actually a vining plant -- when it grows up. 
 Slow-growing, it will take a few years to become a long vine studded with hearts. Mature vining plants will grow clusters of flowers in summer, when given plenty of sunlight. Typically pink with red star-shaped centers, they resemble the blooms of the popular 
 Hoya carnosa 
 . 
  
  
  
 Hoya kerrii plants are often sold as single leafs in individual pots. 
  
 Repot in spring 
 , only when needed. 
 This plant 
  is so slow, it may stay in the same pot for years. When you pot up, use one that's only 1-2 inches larger. A container that's too large for the plant will hold too much water, which may lead to root rot. 
 Make it bloom. 
  
 Hoyas 
  may not bloom for a few years, so be patient. You can help it, though, by keeping it root-bound in a smallish pot. Give it several hours of bright, indirect sunlight each day in summer. Cooler nighttime temperatures can help, too. Just a 10° drop at night will do. After the flowers are spent,  
 don't cut off the flower stem 
  because it will likely bloom again. 
 Train your plant. 
  
 Use florist wire or soft garden ties to 
 support the vines on a trellis. You want to show off the captivating heart leaves, don't you? Or put them in a hanging basket to display them at eye-level. 
  
 The truth about your heart-leaf  
 Hoya 
  plant. 
  
 Hoya kerrii 
 is usually sold as a single, potted leaf cutting. 
 To grow into a vine, it needs part of a stem with a node attached. (A 
 node 
 is where the leaf is attached to the stem. It contains cells that will grow roots.)  If your leaf cutting doesn't have the node attached, you'll enjoy it for several years. Just as it is. A heart-shaped leaf. 
  
  
 Buying Tips for Hoya Kerrii 
  
 Its unique heart shape makes it 
 a popular novelty plant, sold as gifts for Valentine's Day. You may find it for sale as 
 Valentine Hoya or Sweetheart Hoya.  
 Hoya kerrii 
  'Variegata' has green and creamy white- or yellow-edged leaves. Buy one the size you want, otherwise you may wait years for it to grow into a large, vining plant. 
  
 Caring for Hoya Kerrii Plant Indoors 
  
 Origin: 
 Southeast Asia 
 Height: 
 Stems can grow to 6 ft (1.8 m)  or more. 
 Light: 
 Bright, indirect light year-round.  
 Don't have a sunny spot? 
 Artificial grow lights 
  
 work beautifully. Put your  
 Hoya 
  plant about 8 inches (20 cm) beneath the light and keep the lights on for about 
 14 hours a day. It's also important to give them darkness at night. Plants need a rest, too. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly spring through fall, allowing potting mix to dry out a bit between waterings. This succulent 
 won't tolerate soggy soil. Be sure to use a pot with drainage holes and 
 empty the drainage tray. Use room-temperature water for your houseplants; cold water can shock them. In winter, 
 water sparingly 
 giving the plant just enough to keep the mix from drying out completely. Brown or wrinkled leaves indicate the plant is too dry. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative 
 humidity 
 ). Dry air isn't a problem with this succulent. 
 Temperature: 
 Average to warm room temperatures (65-80°F/18-27°C) year-round. It will tolerate a minimum of 50°F/10°C. Keep  
 Hoya kerrii 
  out of drafts and away from heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 Grow in good-quality potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly spring through fall with a water-soluble 
 fertilizer specially made for succulents, diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
 Take 3 in (7 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring. Cut just below a node (the place where a leaf is attached to the stem). The node contains cells that will grow roots. Cuttings should include at least 1 pair of leaves. They 
 will root in moist potting mix.

 Jade Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Crassula ovata 
 A popular house plant, Jade Plant care is easy. 
 Native to South Africa, this many-branched, succulent shrub tolerates the dry environment of warm, heated homes well. 
  
  
  
  
 Its tree-like woody branches are covered with shiny, plump, spoon-shaped green leaves that are sometimes tinged in crimson. 
 Plants that are several years old may produce clusters of white, star-shaped flowers if given enough sun. They just get more beautiful with age. Put a large Jade in a decorative container; its branching growth habit makes it a stunning, tree-like accent for a sunny room. 
  
 Jade plant is easy to grow indoors, preferring warmth and sunshine year-round. 
  
 Caring for Jade Plant 
  
 This South African succulent doesn't need much attention at all. Just put it in a bright location. Wait till the top of the soil is 
 dry before watering because this succulent plant stores water in its fleshy leaves, woody stems and thick roots. It branches naturally, so it doesn't need pruning. 
 Slow-growing, Jade only needs repotted when it outgrows its container, probably every 2-3 years. Put your plant in a heavy container 
 to help balance its weight -- it can get top-heavy. Also, be sure to use a container with a drainage hole to keep the 
 soil from getting soggy. 
 Jade plant problems are few. Watch for  
 mealybugs  
 -- the white, fuzzy bugs that attach themselves to the leaves and 
 stems. A wilted plant could be a sign of an infestation. However, overwatering could also cause wilting. 
 Brown, shriveled spots on leaves or dropping leaves are signs that the soil is too dry. 
 Keep this succulent plant on the dry side, but don't allow it to dry out completely. 
  
 What sets this Crassulaceae apart from many other types of succulents is its branched, tree-like form. 
  
 Jade Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  Up to 3 ft (90 cm). When grown as a bonsai, jade plant only reaches 1 ft (30 cm) or less. 
 Light: 
  Bright light with some direct sun. Give your jade plant a quarter turn every week or so to expose all side to sunlight for even growth. Spindly plants with few leaves need more sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Jade plant stores is a succulent that stores water in its leaves, stems and thick roots, allowing it to go for days without a drink. Allow soil to dry out slightly between waterings, but don't allow the soil to get completely dry. Dropped leaves or brown spots on leaves are signs that the plant 
 needs more water. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room humidity (about 40% relative humidity). Jade will tolerate dry air. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C) all year long. If you move your plant outdoors for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. Bring it back indoors when the nighttime temperature drops -- it will tolerate a minimum of 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
 Give this succulent plant a fast-draining mix to prevent root rot, such as 2 parts peat moss-based potting mix and 1 part horticultural sand or perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly from spring through fall with a liquid fertilizer specially made for succulents, diluted by half. Do not feed in winter when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
  Take leaf cuttings or 3-inch (7.5 cm) stem cuttings in spring. Allow cuttings to dry out for about 5 days (to prevent them from oozing sap) before potting them in moist potting mix.

 Growing Living Stones (Lithops) Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Lithops 
  species 
 Living Stones are flowering succulents that blend into their native environment because they 
 grow in a stemless clump 
 resembling small stones. 
 Their fleshy, swollen leaves are often green, gray or brown with mottled markings. Although some species may be bright green, red, pink, orange, blue-green or any combination.

 They split across the top 
 with big, daisy-like flowers emerging in fall. The flowers don't last long, but they add a burst of color to the natural stone shades; they may be bright yellow or white, depending on the species. 
 Lithops may not bloom for the first 2-3 years, so be patient. It is a long-lived plant and is fascinating to watch through its growth cycle. 
 Once the flowers fade, the leaves will open and a new 
 pair of leaves will push up through the split to replace them. 
  
 Repotting lithops is 
 only necessary every 5 years or so, when the plants become crowded in the pot. Use a pot 6 in (15 cm) deep 
 because this plant grows long taproots. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Lithops Species 
  
 Many varieties are available. You'll find each Lithops species for sale by its scientific name:  
 Lithops karasmontana 
  has mottled 
 brown markings with white flowers,  
 Lithops marmorata 
 is grayish-brown with white flowers and  
 Lithops aucampiae 
 is brown with 
 reddish-brown markings and yellow flowers. 
 Mix them up for an attractive display. Grow 2 or 3 species in the same pot. Or pot them up in matching containers to group together. Surround them with pebbles for decoration. 
  
 Living Stones Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 Up to 2 inches (5 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 In summer, give Lithops plenty of bright light, 
 with at least 4 hours of direct sun a day. 
 A sunny windowsill is an ideal spot for it. 
 From fall through spring, give it indirect light. 
 Water: 
  
 Be careful not to overwater lithops and provide good drainage. 
 This succulent stores moisture and nutrients in its leaves, and its roots will rot if kept too wet. 
 Aim to keep soil barely moist from spring through fall, allowing the top half of the soil to dry out 
 between waterings. Do not water after the flowers have faded and the leaves begin to shrivel. Resume watering 
 the following spring. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 30-40% relative humidity) or lower. 
 Temperature: 
 Keep Lithops warm to hot in summer (70°-90°F/21°-32°C). Autumn through spring, cool to average (60°-70°F/16°-21°C). Go ahead and put it outdoors, if you want. Just bring it back inside when the temperature drops. It will tolerate a minimum temperature of 
 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
 Cactus potting mix is the best for Lithops because it is fast-draining -- ideal for this water-storing succulent. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed once in spring and once in fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Seeds, or divide clumps in early summer. To sow seeds, sprinkle seeds on top of moistened potting mix and barely cover with additional mix. Use a container with drainage holes. Place container in a warm, sunny window. Mist with water occasionally; seedlings will appear in a few weeks.

 Madagascar Palm 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pachypodium lamerei 
 Madagascar Palm is long-lived and easy to please. This semi-succulent plant requires very little water, even less in the winter. 
 Just put it the full sun of a west- or south-facing window and it needs little attention to thrive.

 Did you know... 
  
 Pachypodium 
  comes from the Greek  
 pachy 
  meaning thick and  
 podium 
  meaning foot, referring to the thick trunk of this tree. 
  
  
 This popular 
 Pachypodium 
 has a shiny silver trunk covered with long, sharp spines. The trunk may branch out, making 
 it even more attractive.  
 A tuft of long, narrow leaves grow only at the top of 
 the trunk, like a palm tree. However, this Madagascar native isn't really a palm but a succulent from the Apocynaceae family. 
  
 In the summer, clusters of fragrant, white 
 flowers will appear on mature plants that are grown outdoors. Don't expect it to 
 bloom indoors, unless you can provide plenty of direct sunlight. 
 You may want to move this sun-loving succulent 
 outdoors to your porch or patio for the summer. Just remember to bring it back inside when the temperature drops -- 
 it won't tolerate frost. 
 Repot in spring 
  every 3-4 years or when it outgrows its pot. It's a good idea to use a heavy container to prevent toppling. This thick-trunked 
 tree can get top-heavy. Also, be careful of those sharp spines when handling this plant. Wear thick garden gloves and wrap a newspaper 
 or old towel around the trunk while repotting to protect your hands. 
 Leaf drop 
  in winter is perfectly normal. Madagascar palm may even drop all its leaves. But, don't worry. 
 It'll grow more leaves in spring when it gets the sunshine and warmth it loves. When it comes out of dormancy and you 
 see new leaves growing, that's your cue to resume normal watering and fertilizing. 
  
 Madagascar Palm Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar, Africa 
 Height: 
  Can reach 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors, much taller if grown outdoors in a frost-free climate. 
 Light: 
  Full sun 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly and allow top half of soil to dry out between waterings. In winter, water sparingly just to keep 
 the soil from drying out completely. Plant in a pot with drainage holes to prevent root rot. 
 Humidity: 
  Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. If you move Madagascar palm outdoors 
 for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. Just bring it back in when the temperature drops; it will tolerate a minimum in winter of 40°F/4°C. 
 Soil: 
  Cactus potting mix 
 works well to provide fast drainage. Or you can use 2 parts all-purpose potting 
 mix with 1 part sharp sand or perlite. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed in spring and summer with a cactus/succulent fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Sow seeds 
 in spring. Offsets can be cut away from the parent plant and potted up separately.

 Mistletoe Cactus 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Rhipsalis baccifera 
  and other species 
 Spiky, branched stems punctuating the air makes mistletoe cactus an exciting plant for any room. Some species are more weeping 
 than others, trailing over the sides of the pot. Put one in a hanging basket to show it off at eye-level.

 Its long, cylindrical stems are jointed, branching naturally. You won't need to prune it, unless you want. 
 Handle the plant carefully -- those stems are fragile and may break off at the stem joints. 
 You can expect small greenish-white flowers to appear in late winter or spring, followed by white fruits that look similar 
 to the berries on mistletoe. You'll often find this plant labeled Mistletoe Cactus. 
  
 Tropical Beginnings 
  
 Although this is a true cactus, its origins are in the tropical rain forests, where  
 Rhipsalis 
  makes its home as 
 an  
 epiphyte 
 , hanging on a tree branch. Forget what you think you know about cacti, this one is a jungle native and needs high humidity and indirect sunlight. 
  
 Tiny, white flowers are soon replaced by white berries. Photo: © Prispim 
  
 Mistletoe Cactus Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Wondering when to repot? 
  Repot every couple years, keeping this sprawling succulent in a smallish pot. Wait till the spring flowers have faded -- never 
 repot a plant while it's blooming. 
 Shriveled, reddish stems 
  are caused by too much sunlight. Shade mistletoe cactus from hot, direct sunlight, especially in summer. 
 No blooms? 
  Provide plenty of bright, indirect light. Fertilize your plant to encourage flowering. 
 Is  
 Rhipsalis baccifera 
  poisonous? 
  No. It's non-toxic for cats and dogs. 
  
 Despite its tropical beginnings, Mistletoe Cactus adapts well as a houseplant. 
  
 Mistletoe Cactus Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil and Peru 
 Height: 
  Varies by species; many will trail to 6 ft/1.8 m indoors, unless pruned back. 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect light year-round. Shade from direct sunlight, especially in summer, which causes the 
 stems to turn red and look shriveled. This tropical cactus thrives under  
 indoor grow lights 
 . 
 Water: 
  In spring and summer, allow the potting medium to dry out slightly between waterings; water less in winter. 
 Humidity: 
  This cactus is native to rain forests where it lives with high humidity. Indoor air can become extremely dry in winter, so it's a good idea to use a humidity gauge and maintain 50% relative humidity around the plant; this is easier than it seems. Discover ways to  
 increase humidity 
  for your houseplants. 
 Temperature: 
  70-75°F/21-24°C days and 60-70°F/16-21°C nights 
 Soil: 
  Mix 1 part peat moss-based potting mix and 1 part fine-grade fir bark. Don't pack the potting medium down. An epiphyte in its native habitat, this cactus likes a little air around its roots. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once a month with a fertilizer specially made for cacti and succulents. 
 Propagation: 
  Use a sharp, clean knife, scissors or a razor blade to take stem cuttings. A milky, white sap may ooze 
 from the cuttings, so allow the cut ends to dry for a day or two. Then insert the cut end 
 into a sterile potting medium. Keep the medium lightly moist.

 Mother-in-Law's Tongue or Snake Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Sansevieria trifasciata 
  
 Mother-in-Law's Tongue (also known as Snake Plant) is one of the most carefree 
 house plants you can grow. It thrives in just about any light. Prefers dry air and soil. Rarely needs repotted. 
 This succulent house plant grows stiffly upright variegated leaves. 
  
  
  
  
 Mother-In-Law's Tongue Varieties 
  
 Some varieties have leaves that are edged with yellow or white. 
 'Laurentii' 
 is a popular variety that is edged in golden yellow. 
 S. trifasciata 
 'Hahnii' is a low-growing (6 in/15 cm) variety. Its compact, rosette form 
 gives it the common name Bird's Nest Sansevieria. 
 'Golden Hahnii' has yellow leaf margins...'Silver Hahnii' has silvery leaves 
 marbled with dark green. 
 S.t. 
 'Hahnii' (shown at left) is a compact, low-growing variety that only reaches a few inches tall. 
 Clusters of small, white flowers sometimes grow at the base of a plant when it is a few years old. It rarely 
 blooms indoors, and it may go years between flowering, so it's a nice surprise when it does. 
 Mother-in-Law's Tongue is ideal for beginners, but seasoned gardeners also love this accent plant's dramatic, sword-shaped leaves. 
 Slow-growing, it will live for many years with good care. 
  
 Watering Tip 
  
 Water the soil, taking care not to get water on the leaves, which will cause them to rot. If the leaves turn yellow, or get soft and mushy at their base, it's overwatered. 
  
  
 Any problems with growing  
 Sansevieria 
 are usually related to watering. Allow the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil 
 to dry out between waterings during the growing season. In winter, water just enough to prevent the soil from 
 drying out. Overwatering will cause root rot. 
 Keep the leaves dust-free and glossy by wiping them with a damp cloth. 
 Repot in spring, only when plants get crowded and need dividing. Keep the rosette of the leaves at soil level. 
 Use a wide, heavy container to prevent toppling. This tall plant can get top-heavy. 
  
 Sansevieria Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun. Will tolerate low light. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist in the growing season. In winter, water just enough to prevent the 
 soil from drying out. Take care not to water the center of the rosette of leaves because they'll rot easily if kept wet. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). Mother-in-law's tongue will tolerate dry air, but keep it away from air vents or drafts. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C. It will tolerate fluctuating 
 temperatures, but not extreme cold. 
 Soil: 
  Soilless or cactus potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed monthly spring through fall with fertilizer for succulent plants. 
 Propagation: 
 Division or leaf cuttings.  
 Sansevieria 
 is easy to divide because it has shallow roots. Simply 
 turn the pot on its side and pull out the entire plant. Use a sharp knife to cut through the thick roots and pot each clump 
 separately. To propagate  
 Sansevieria 
 by leaf cuttings, cut leaf into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces and place them 
 right side up (the way they were growing) in moist perlite or cactus potting mix; they will grow plantlets around the base of the cuttings.

 Mother of Thousands 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Kalanchoe daigremontiana 
 Mother of Thousands is a succulent that grows from a single stem, covered top to bottom with big, blue-green leaves. Its 
 narrow, pointed leaves can grow to 6 in (15 cm) long and about half as wide. The real attraction are the tiny 
 plantlets that grow along the edges of the leaves, which easily fall off and will root where they drop. 
  
  
  
 You've probably guessed already -- that's how this succulent plant earned its common name. Although a good-looking 
 plant, it can really be a nuisance by spreading itself around. Fortunately, that's not much of a concern when 
 you grow Mother of Thousands indoors. However, you may find its plantlets sprouting in adjacent pots! 
 When grown outdoors, it flowers in late winter then dies, with many offspring to take its place. Bell-shaped flowers 
 grow in a circle on a single, tall stem, but you may never see them because this succulent rarely flowers indoors. 
 Belonging to the Crassulaceae family, they are among a diverse group. Flaming Katy -- admired for its clusters of tiny 
 flowers, and Jade Plant -- a branched tree covered with plump, shiny leaves are just a couple of common house plants 
 in this family tree. They're all leafy succulents and easy to care for, so this  
 Kalanchoe 
  is in good company. 
  
 Tiny plantlets grow along the edges of Kalanchoe daigremontiana leaves. 
  
 Mother of Thousands is easy to grow in average room conditions. One thing it doesn't like is soggy soil, so 
 I'd recommend potting it in a terra cotta pot with drainage holes 
 and using a sandy medium, such as cactus potting mix for fast drainage.

 Repot in spring 
 only when it outgrows its pot. But don't over-pot. Use a container that's only slightly larger so that it doesn't hold too much water, which can cause root rot. 
 All parts of 
 Kalanchoe daigremontiana 
 are poisonous 
 . Keep it out of the reach of children or pets -- it 
 may be fatal if ingested. 
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 You'll find these succulents for sale by many names: Mother of Thousands, Devil's 
 Backbone, Alligator Plant and Mexican Hat Plant. 
 Look for the botanical name  
 Kalanchoe daigremontiana 
 to be sure you're getting this plant. 
  
 Mother of Thousands Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar 
 Height: 
  Up to 2-1/2 ft (75 cm) 
 Light: 
  Like most succulents,  
 Kalanchoe daigremontiana 
  grows best in bright light. It will even enjoy some direct morning sun. Move it outside for the summer, if you want. Just make the move a gradual one to avoid scorching its leaves. Be sure to bring it back indoors if the temperature drops below 40°F/4°C because it won't tolerate any frost. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, then allow top 2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Cut back on watering 
 in winter, but don't allow soil to dry out completely. 
 Water the potting mix or water from the bottom to avoid 
 getting the leaves wet because they may rot. 
 Also, 
 remember to always use room-temperature water when watering your houseplants. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
  Average to warm room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C. If you move your 
 Kalanchoe daigremontiana  
 outdoors for the summer, it 
 will tolerate extreme heat, but not frost. 
 Soil: 
  Grows best in cactus potting mix because it provides fast drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed quarterly with a fertilizer specially made for succulents. 
 Propagation: 
  Easily propagated by the plantlets that fall off its leaves. Or you can break them off 
 and set them on barely-moist cactus potting mix. The best time to propagate is in spring and summer.

 Orchid Cactus Care 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Epiphyllum 
  spp. 
 Big, cup-shaped blooms in gorgeous colors make orchid cactus a joy to grow. Show it off in a hanging basket and 
 allow the long stems to cascade over the pot. 
  
  
  
 Orchid cactus stems are broad and flat with serrated edges. They'll grow to 2 ft (60 cm) long, and about 2 in (5 cm) wide. Not very showy, but you can count on them to burst into bloom every spring. 
  
  
 Flowers emerge at the ends of the stems, and can be 4-8 in (10-20 cm) wide. Most  
 Epiphyllum 
  grown today are 
 hybrids and may be pink, red, white, yellow, orange, purple or bicolored. Give your tropical cactus plenty of light and you'll 
 enjoy months of blooms. 
  
 Pruning Orchid Cactus 
  
 You won't need to prune unless you want to control its size. The 
 best time to prune it back is shortly after it stops flowering. 
 Use sharp, clean pruning shears to prevent tearing the stems. 
 Don't toss out those orchid cactus cuttings! Propagate them to get more of these captivating plants. (See "Propagation" below.) 
  
 Wondering Whether to Repot...or Not? 
  
 Repot every 2-3 years, moving up to a pot 1 size larger. Orchid cactus prefers to be slightly pot-bound and blooms best this way. 
 Never repot while it's blooming, which will cause its buds and blooms to drop. 
 Large plants can be top-dressed instead by adding a layer of fresh potting mix. Allow an inch or so (about 2.5 cm) of space from the rim of the container so soil won't spill out while watering. 
  
  
 How to Make Orchid Cactus Bloom 
  
 Growing this flowering cactus is easy, but a few things you can do will help it to bloom: 
 Give it a winter rest. 
  A cool, dry rest for about 8-10 weeks in winter are needed for the plant to set buds. Water sparingly and stop fertilizing during this time. 
 Shed some light. 
  Keep your orchid cactus in bright, indirect light year-round. If you move it outdoors for the summer, keep the plant shaded from direct sunlight. 
 Feed it. 
  High-phosphorus fertilizer will encourage more blooms. Start feeding in early spring and continue through fall. 
 Leave it alone. 
  Once buds appear, keep the plant in the same location. Changes in light and temperature by moving it around will cause it to drop its buds and flowers. Also keep it away from drafty areas like doorways and heat/AC vents. 
  
  
 Epiphyllum oxypetalum 
  (shown here) is among the most popular species of this genus. It bears white, fragrant 
 flowers that bloom for one night only -- then wither by morning. If you sneak up on it during the night, you'll 
 catch it in full bloom. 
  
  
 Orchid Cactus Problems and Solutions 
  
 Dropped flower buds? 
  
 Once buds set, don't move the plant around. 
 Changes in light will likely cause flower buds to fall off. Don't worry, though -- these tropical hybrids are long-lived and with good care, will bloom beautifully when they get what they want. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Check for  
 scale insects 
  and  
 mealybugs 
 that may attack this plant. Treat any infestation right away and isolate an affected plant to prevent pests from moving on to your other houseplants. 
 Limp stems 
  that turn blackish at the base is stem rot, caused by overwatering. You can cut off any rotted stems at soil-level. 
  
 Orchid Cactus Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
 Central America hybrids 
 Height: 
  To 2 ft (60 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light, but no direct sunlight. Insufficient light causes spindly growth and few blooms. 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil moist spring through fall, while plant is growing. In winter, water sparingly until new 
 growth begins in spring. Never allow it to dry out. Shriveled, limp stems are a sign the soil is too dry. Overwatering leads to stem rot; cut off any damaged stems. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate indoor (about 40-50% relative humidity). Stand the pot on a dish of wet pebbles to  
 boost humidity 
 , if necessary 
 . If your home is extremely dry, the best way to raise humidity is with a cool-mist room humidifier. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. To set flower buds, the plant needs 
 8-10 weeks of cool 60-65°F/16-18°C days and 45-55°F/7-13°C nights in winter. 
 Soil: 
  Mix 1 part peat moss-based potting mix and 1 part perlite for faster drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks from early spring through fall with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer. Don't feed during the winter. 
 Propagation: 
  Detach 4-6 in (10-15 cm) stem sections in spring, allow cut to dry (callous) for a few days, then place cut end upright in lightly moist potting mix. Keep cuttings at room temperature (65-75°F/18-24°C). 
 Stem cuttings root easily in about 4-6 weeks.

 Grow Paddle Plant Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Kalanchoe thyrsiflora 
  
  
  
  
  
 Paddle Plant is an unusual-looking succulent that grows in a rosette of flat, round leaves. It adds bold texture and form to a succulent dish garden. 
 The gray-green leaves grow to about 6 in (15 cm) long and will become tinged in red when exposed to sun. 
 Mature plants may produce a spike of fragrant, yellow flowers in spring. 
 These South African succulents belong to the Crassulaceae family, an extremely varied group. 
 You'll find  
 Kalanchoe thyrsiflora 
  for sale by many names: Paddle Plant, Desert Cabbage and Flapjack Plant are 
 the most common. 
  
 Kalanchoe thyrsiflora: 3 Keys to Success 
  
 Shed some light. 
  Like most succulents, this plant grows best in bright light. It will even enjoy 
 some direct sun. Move it outside for the summer, if you want. Just make the move a gradual one to avoid 
 scorching its leaves. Be sure to bring it back indoors if the temperature drops below 50°F/10°C at night. 
 Keep it on the dry side. 
   
 K. thyrsiflora 
  is easy to grow in average room conditions, tolerating the dry air of heated 
 homes well. The one thing it doesn't like is soggy soil, so I'd recommend potting it in a terra cotta pot with drainage holes 
 and using a sandy medium, such as cactus potting mix for fast drainage. 
 Repot in spring 
  when it becomes crowded -- but don't over-pot. Use a container that's only slightly larger. Why? Plants grow best when their roots are snug in the pot. 
  
 Paddle Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
 To 24 in (60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Thrives in bright light to full sun. Give the pot a quarter turn every week or so to expose all sides to sunlight. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, then allow top 2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Don't allow soil to get soggy or the roots may rot. 
 Avoid getting the leaves wet to prevent rot. Water the potting mix or water from the bottom. 
 Remember to always use room-temperature water when watering your house plants. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 40% relative humidity). 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 65-75°F/18-24°C. It will tolerate a minimum of 
 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
  Cactus potting mix. Or mix 2 parts potting mix with 1 part horticultural sand. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed quarterly with a cactus/succulent fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
  Take leaf cuttings in spring or summer and pot in moist cactus potting mix. It's much easier to propagate from seeds, which are easy to find online.

 Panda Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Kalanchoe tomentosa 
  
 Thick, soft, furry leaves give Panda Plant its common name. Other names for this 
 succulent plant are Pussy Ears and Chocolate Soldier. 
  
  
  
  
 Kalanchoe tomentosa 
  is in the Crassulaceae family and includes more than 100 species. 
 The most popular species for growing indoors is flowering Flaming Katy ( 
 Kalanchoe blossfeldiana 
 ). 
 Branching from the central stem, the plump, rounded leaves taper to a point. They're silvery green marked with reddish-brown 
 edges. The "fur" is actually soft, fine hair that covers these succulent plants. 
 In its native habitat, Panda Plant produces fuzzy, bell-shaped flowers in spring and summer. However, it rarely flowers 
 indoors. 
 Decorative year-round, it makes a beautiful addition to a  
 succulent dish garden 
 . 
 Like other succulent types, it stores water so it rarely needs watering. 
 Water carefully. 
 Avoid getting the furry leaves of this plant wet because they'll easily rot. 
 Water from the bottom or water the potting mix. 
 If the leaves need to be cleaned, brush them gently with a soft, dry brush, such as a small paintbrush. 
 Leggy plants (tall stems with long spaces between leaves) are a sign the plant needs more sunlight. Move to a sunny window. 
 Repot in spring, only when it's outgrowing its pot. Move Panda Plant to a container only 1 size larger. Pots that are too big will hold too much water for this succulent. Also be sure to use a pot with a drainage hole. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, just slip it into a  
 cachepot  
  
 (a decorative container without holes). It's a good idea to put some pebbles in the bottom of the cachepot to keep the nursery pot above any drainage water. 
 And like other types of succulents,  
 Kalanchoe tomentosa 
  is tolerant of dry air. It makes a good house plant for heated 
 homes. Just give it plenty of light and it'll thrive for many years. 
  
 Panda Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar 
 Height: 
 Up to 1 ft (30 cm) indoors 
 Light: 
 Bright light to full sun. Put this succulent in a bright location year-round. 
 If you move it outdoors for the warm months, move it gradually into full sun to avoid scorching its leaves. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly, allowing the top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings. Take care not to get the fuzzy leaves wet because they can rot. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room humidity (around 40% relative humidity) or lower. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures 60-75°F/16-24°C 
 Soil: 
  Cactus potting mix provides fast drainage, which this succulent requires. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in spring and summer with a fertilizer specially made for succulent plants. 
 Propagation: 
 Take leaf cuttings in spring or early summer. Succulent cuttings root easily in moist 
 sandy mix or perlite.

 Ponytail Palm 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Beaucarnea recurvata 
 Often mistaken for a palm, Ponytail Palm is actually a semi-succulent more closely related to the Yucca. 
  
  
  
 One of the easiest houseplants, this one is also eye-catching. Photo: © Lucie Zrnova 
  
 This plant is easy to grow and drought-tolerant. Its swollen base stores water, so occasional lack of water will do no harm. 
 Are you forgetful about watering? This may be the ideal house plant for you. In fact, the most common mistake with this plant 
 is overwatering it, especially in winter. When in doubt, keep it on the dry side. 
 At the top of its trunk, long, narrow green leaves grow in a cluster, curving downward like a pony's tail. Keep them 
 dust-free by spraying leaves with room-temperature water, then wiping them with a soft cloth. Cleaning the leaves will 
 also help to prevent  
 spider mites 
  that prefer the same dry living conditions as the ponytail palm tree. 
 Clusters of small, white flowers may appear on plants when they are several years old. However, plants that are grown indoors rarely flower. 
 Beaucarnea recurvata 
  
 is a slow-grower, so buy one the size you want. Otherwise, you'll wait 
 for years for it to grow into a large tree. 
  
 Ponytail Palm Care: Problems, Solutions and Answers 
  
 Brown leaf tips? 
  If you find that the leaf tips are turning brown, it is caused by overwatering and underwatering. Snip off brown leaf 
 tips with sharp scissors or pruners, but take care not to cut too much off. 
 Wondering when to repot? 
  Good ponytail palm care will ensure that your house plant will live a long time. Slow-growing, it rarely needs repotted (probably every 5 years or so). 
 In fact, it grows best when it's pot-bound so keep it in a smallish pot. As it grows tall, it's a good idea to pot it in a heavy container to prevent toppling. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy potting medium. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, use it as a  
 cachepot 
  -- a decorative container without drainage holes. Just slip the plain pot into the cachepot. I put small rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
 Ponytail Palm typically shrugs off pests; however, there are a couple to watch for. Check for  
 scale insects 
 . These tiny, brown disc-shaped bugs may be found lurking on the undersides of leaves. Scale are sap-sucking pests that excrete honeydew, which often develops sooty mold. 
 Spider mites 
  are attracted to dry conditions, especially in winter, and can cause devastation to plants. You'll recognize them by the fine webbing between leaves. 
 Treat any infestation right away and isolate the plant to prevent bugs moving on to your other houseplants. 
  
 Ponytail Palm Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico 
 Height: 
  Slow-growing, it can take 20 years to reach 6 ft (2 m) indoors. Ponytail Palm is easy to grow as a bonsai, reaching 
 only 1-2 ft (30-60 cm) tall -- it doesn't need shaped or pruned at all. 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun, year-round. 
 Ponytail palm makes an easy-to-please house plant and a striking accent for a sunny room. 
 Water: 
 Allow soil to dry out between waterings. In winter, water only enough to prevent the soil from drying out completely. 
 Avoid getting the trunk wet because it is prone to rot; water the potting mix instead. 
 Remember to always use room-temperature water when watering your houseplants. 
 Humidity: 
  Average (around 40% relative humidity) or lower. 
 A native of the Mexican desert, this house plant tolerates the dry air of heated homes extremely well. 
  
 Temperature: 
 Warm room temperatures 65-80°F/18-27°C year-round. If you move your plant outdoors for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. Keep it in a sheltered spot outside. Bring it back indoors when the temperature drops to 50°F/10°C at night. 
 Soil: 
  A fast-draining medium, such as cactus potting mix is ideal. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Slow-growing, Ponytail Palm is not a heavy feeder. Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10) water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended amount on the label. Don't feed in winter, when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
 Can be sown from seeds. In spring, you can remove the offsets that grow from the base of the plant and pot them 
 in their own containers.

 String of Pearls Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Senecio rowleyanus 
 String of Pearls plant looks just as it sounds, with round, succulent leaves 
 carried down long, slender stems. They look more like peas than pearls, but this succulent is definitely a gem. 
 Pot your String of Pearls succulent plant in a hanging basket to show off its trailing strands of bead-like leaves. Plant several young plants together for a full, attractive display. 
  
  
  
  
 Despite its delicate appearance, this unusual succulent house plant is a vigorous grower, quickly 
 creeping across the surface of the pot, then cascading down the side. 
 Its trailing stems can reach 2-3 ft (60-90 cm). If long stems become straggly, you can cut them off. 
 Poke healthy stem tip cuttings back into the soil to create a full, lush plant. (See propagation tips below.) 
 String of Pearls has such unlikely relatives as Cineraria, with broad green foliage and bright, daisy-like flowers... 
 and German Ivy, a trailing plant with lobed ivy-shaped leaves. 
 Although the Senecio genus includes more than 1,000 species of leafy annuals, perennials, succulents and shrubs, 
 what many have in common are rayed flowerheads. 
 Make it bloom. 
 Give your String of Pearls plant a cool (55-60°F/13-16°C) rest in winter. Cut back on watering during the 
 winter months, but don't allow the potting mix to dry out completely. 
 These cool, dry conditions may promote blooming in spring. And the flowers are spectacular -- clusters of small, white trumpet-shaped 
 flowers studded with colorful stamens. 
 Wondering whether to repot? 
  This succulent has small roots, so you won't need to repot often. Keep the crown of the plant at the same soil level as it was in the old pot -- the stems will rot if they are buried. Use a sandy mix for fast drainage and a pot with drainage holes. 
  
 Buying Tip 
  
 You'll find String of Pearls for sale at online nurseries. 
 This succulent grows quickly, so you can buy a small plant. 
  
  
  
 String of Pearls Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Southwest Africa 
 Height: 
  Trails 2-3 ft (60-90 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light with some direct sun 
 Water: 
  
 Keep your String of Pearls plant lightly moist during the growing 
 season (spring through fall). 
 Cut back on water in winter, watering just enough to prevent the soil from drying out. 
 Beads that look flat are a sign that the soil is too dry. Give it a good 
 drink, but take care not to overwater. 
 This succulent will not tolerate soggy soil. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room humidity (about 40% relative humidity) or lower. Dry air won't hurt this succulent. 
 Temperature: 
  Warm spring through fall (70-80°F/21-27°C). In winter, cool (55-60°F/13-16°C). 
 Want to move String of Pearls outdoors for the warm months? It can take the heat, but keep it 
 shaded from the hot midday sun in summer, which will burn its foliage. 
 Soil: 
 Fast-draining potting medium, such as cactus potting mix. Wet potting medium will likely cause root rot. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed once a month spring through fall with a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer specially made for succulents. I usually use half the amount recommended on the package. String of pearls plant isn't a heavy feeder. 
 Propagation: 
  Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer and insert them in moist 
 potting medium. Press them into the potting mix until the leaves are almost covered. Keep the medium lightly 
 moist. They will root quickly from the axils where the leaves are attached to the stem.

 Grow Sedum Rubrotinctum Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Sedum rubrotinctum 
 Many plants in the Sedum family make good houseplants. Because of its easy-growing nature and good looks, 
 S. rubrotinctum 
  is one of the most popular of this clan to come indoors. 
  
  
  
 Plump, rounded leaves give this popular  succulent the common name Jelly Bean Plant. 
  
 Jelly Bean makes a beautiful, colorful addition to a succulent dish garden. Stems will eventually grow long enough to trail over the side of the container, so you can display your plant in a hanging basket if you want. 
 In spring, you can expect 
 Sedum rubrotinctum 
   
 to bloom with bright-yellow, star-shaped flowers. No blooms? Your plant may still be too young or not getting enough sunlight. 
  
 Let it bask in the sun. 
  Move your plant outdoors for the summer, if you want. This good-natured succulent can take the heat. Those bright green leaves will even get more beautiful, turning red at the tips after sun exposure. 
 Repot in spring 
 , only when your plant gets too crowded. Handle this plant carefully -- those leaves may fall off at the slightest touch. But don't toss them out... you can propagate the leaves for more plants. Just poke the cut end into moist potting medium and they'll root easily. 
 Dropped leaves? 
  Jelly Bean Plant will drop its leaves if it is either over-watered or under-watered. Use a pot with drainage holes so you can water thoroughly without drowning the plant. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, just slip it into a  
 cachepot 
 -- a decorative container without drainage holes. See "Water" tips below. 
  
  
 Buying Tips 
  
 Sedum rubrotinctum 
  is easy to find in garden centers, plant shops and online. You may find it listed with common names Jelly Bean Plant or Pork and Beans. One new cultivar that's getting attention is 'Aurora' which has pink-tinged leaves instead of red. 
  
  
  
 Sedum Rubrotinctum Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
 Mexico 
 Height: 
  Up to 8 in (20 cm) 
 Light: 
  
 This hardy succulent thrives in bright, indirect light to full sunlight. Don't have a sunny window? Use a  
 grow light 
 . If you move your plant outdoors for the summer,  make the move a gradual one; indoor-grown plants can sunburn easily. 
 Water: 
 Water thoroughly throughout the growing season, allowing the potting medium to dry out between waterings. 
 Water sparingly in winter when growth is slow. It's better to err on the dry side -- this desert succulent is more tolerant of dry potting medium than wet. 
 Humidity: 
 Average room (around 30-40% relative humidity) or drier. Humidity isn't really a concern with this desert native. 
 Temperature: 
 Average room temperatures (65-75°F/18-24°C). If you move your plant outdoors for the warm months, don't worry -- it can take the heat. Bring it back indoors when nighttime temps drop to 50°F/10°C. 
 Soil: 
 Sandy, fast-draining medium, such as cactus potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed monthly in spring and summer with a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer specially made for succulents, diluted by half. 
 Propagation: 
  Easy to grow from stems or leaves. Allow the stem or leaf to dry for about a day, so it doesn't ooze sap. Poke a short stem or a leaf into lightly moist potting medium and  
 S. rubrotinctum 
  will readily grow roots in about 3-4 weeks. Keep the plant out of direct sun until it shows new growth.

 Thanksgiving Cactus 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Schlumbergera truncata 
  
 Thanksgiving Cactus is a member of the Cactaceae family. 
 Schlumbergera 
 truncata 
 is the parent of many hybrid 
 Schlumbergeras 
 . 
 In its native habitat, this rain forest cactus is 
 epiphytic 
 , making its home on trees. 
  
  
  
 Vibrant, bi-color blooms make Thanksgiving Cactus a must-have houseplant. 
  
 What You Should Know About Schlumbergeras 
  
 Some misconceptions exist about how to grow this tropical cactus. Don't treat this holiday bloomer like its desert relatives. Consider 
 Schlumbergera's 
 native habitat, were it's perched on a tree branch in the South American jungle...under the canopy of tall trees and vines...bathed in high humidity. 
  
 Give your plant what it wants, and you'll enjoy it for many years. Some people tell me they've had their  
 Schlumbergera truncata 
  for a few decades. 
 This is a relative of the Christmas Cactus, which likes the same tropical treatment. 
 You can identify its Christmas cousin by its smooth, scalloped stems and later bloom time. 
 Thanksgiving cacti have toothed stem segments that are long and narrow, connected by a mid-rib. Its deeply indented stems look like crab claws, 
 giving it a second common name,  
 Crab Cactus 
 . 
  
 Thanksgiving Cactus Varieties 
  
 In late fall, this tropical cactus bears big, beautiful 
 flowers, which may be red, pink, peach, orange, white, or bicolored. 
 Many cultivars are available to choose from. 
 The names are almost as tempting as their spectacular blooms. 
 Here are just a few... 
 'Peach Parfait' 
 and 
 'Twilight Tangerine' 
 have peach and 
 orange blossoms, respectively... 
 'Red Radiance' 
 is dark crimson... 
 'Majestic' 
 is purple. 
  
 Keep your holiday cactus in front of a bright, cool window while it's in bloom. 
  
 Caring for Thanksgiving Cactus Year-Round 
  
 Prune it. 
  You'll get a fuller plant by pruning. Cutting it back in spring will encourage the plant to branch out where the stem was cut. 
 Flowers emerge from the ends of the stems so you'll get more blooms this way. Spring is the best time to prune it back, 
 when it begins actively growing again.  
 Don't toss those cuttings 
  -- propagate them for more plants. 
  
 Pruning Tip: 
  
 Cut the stem off between segments (the place where they're joined together by a midrib). Use sharp, clean pruning shears to prevent tearing the stems. 
  
  
 How to get the blooms. 
  Flowering results from shorter, cooler days for 8-10 weeks. Putting your cactus outdoors 
 in early fall is ideal. Be sure it's in a shaded location. Bring it back inside before the first frost. Once buds set, 
 don't move the plant around. Flower buds are likely to drop off if the plant is moved or suddenly exposed to temperature 
 changes. If this happens, don't worry. It will bloom beautifully next year. 
 Late bloomer? 
  Thanksgiving cactus plants are brought into bloom by greenhouse growers to sell before the holiday. You can depend on your plant to flower freely every year, but don't be surprised if it doesn't bloom on schedule after the first year. Flowers may appear a little later in the season than when you purchased your plant. 
 Repot in early summer 
  when roots fill the pot. Never repot a plant that's in bloom; wait till it has finished blooming. Use a pot just 1- to 2-inches larger. Why? A pot that's too big will hold too much water. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy potting medium, which can lead to root rot. Want to use a decorative container without drainage holes? Use it as a cachepot. Slip a plain nursery pot into the cachepot to cover it up. It's a good idea to put small rocks in the bottom of the cachepot to keep the inner pot above drainage water. 
  
 Thanksgiving Cactus Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Brazil 
 Height: 
  12-24 in (30-60 cm) 
 Light: 
 Bright indirect light 
 Water: 
  Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy while plant is growing. After flowering, water sparingly until new 
 growth begins in spring. Stems will shrivel or wilt if the roots are too dry. 
 Humidity: 
 This jungle native does best with moderate to high humidity, preferably 50% or above. Check out these tips for  
 raising the humidity 
  for your tropical plants. 
 Temperature: 
 To set flower buds, Thanksgiving cactus needs cool 60-65°F/16-18°C days and 45-55°F/7-13°C nights. Once buds set, 
 70-75°F/21-24°C days and 60-70°F/16-21°C nights. 
 Soil: 
  Mix 1 part potting soil and 1 part fine-grade fir bark. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. After blooms have dropped, stop 
 fertilizing until new growth begins in spring. 
 Propagation: 
  Take stem cuttings (2 to 3 attached segments) in spring or early summer. Allow the cut ends to dry for a day; they'll form a callous where they were cut to prevent sap from oozing. Then place stems upright (the same direction they were growing) in moist perlite.

 Tiger's Jaw 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Faucaria tigrina 
  
 Tiger's Jaw lives up to its common name. The sharp spines that edge the pairs of speckled leaves look like the teeth 
 of a ferocious tiger. Their low-growing habit and unusual leaves make a spectacular addition to a succulent dish 
 garden. 
 These South African succulents grow in clumps of stemless, star-shaped rosettes in its dry, rocky native habitat. Give them 
 the same hot, dry, sunny environment and they'll feel right at home.

 In fall, yellow, daisy-like flowers may appear on plants that are a few years old. However, they won't bloom 
 without 3-4 hours of direct sun each day during the summer. Moving your plant outdoors for the summer will give it 
 the light these succulents need. 
 Tiger's Jaw prefers slightly cooler temperatures in the winter, but this succulent is not cold-hardy. If you move it outdoors 
 for the summer, be sure to bring it back indoors when nighttime temperatures drop below 60°F/16°C. 
 Winter care. 
  Give  
 Faucaria tigrina 
 a rest in winter. Cut back on water, stop fertilizing, and provide average room temperatures and full sunlight -- 
 a sunny window is ideal. In spring, resume normal care. 
 Wondering when to repot? 
  Repot every 2-3 years, or when they outgrow their containers. Tiger's Jaw succulents have small roots, so you can 
 grow them in shallow containers. Be sure the pots have drainage holes to prevent root rot. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  
 Mealybugs 
  are small insects that look like little tufts of white fuzz and are the most common pest found on succulents. Many people mistakenly believe there is only one type of mealybug; however, there are several species, which can invade leaves, stems and roots of plants. Check over your plant and treat any infestation immediately. 
  
 Plenty of sunshine will bring on the blooms. Image credit:

 Tiger's Jaw Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  Up to 6 in (15 cm) 
  
 Light: 
  Bright light with some direct sun.  
 Faucaria tigrina 
  needs at least 3-4 hours of direct sunlight to bloom. 
  
 Water: 
  Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. In winter, allow soil to dry out between waterings. 
  
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 30-40% relative humidity)  
  
 Temperature: 
  Warmer spring through fall 70-90°F/21-32°C. Average temperatures in winter, 60-75°F/16-24°C.  
  
 Soil: 
   
 Cactus and Succulent Potting Mix 
 . Or use 2 parts potting mix with 1 part sand. 
  
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a  
 2-7-7 liquid plant food 
  diluted by half. 
Do not feed in winter. 
  
 Propagation: 
  Offsets will grow at the base of the parent plant. Cut them away with a sharp knife. Allow the 
cut surface to dry for a day so it doesn't ooze sap and to prevent the new plant from rotting. Plant the offsets in a 
lightly moist, sandy potting mixture. Keep new offsets in a warm, bright place, but out of direct sun for the first month. 
The best time to propagate is late spring to early summer, when succulents are beginning their most active period of growth.

 Yucca Plant 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: 
 Yucca elephantipes 
  
  
  
 Gaining in popularity, the yucca plant makes a beautiful floor accent year-round. 
 Many cultivars are available to choose from. 
 'Variegata' 
  leaves are broadly edged in white... and  
 'Silver Star' 
  has silvery gray-green leaves. 
 Yuccas are available as either stemless leaf rosettes or as stout, cane-like trees with one or two leaf rosettes at the top. 
 Young plants are stemless rosettes of long, sword-shaped leaves with pointed tips. 
 As they mature, yucca plants develop thick, woody trunks with several arching leaf rosettes at the top. 
 The edges of these leaves are spineless, and not as sharp as others in this genus, giving  
 Y. elephantipes 
  the 
 common name Spineless Yucca. 
  
  
 Place a young plant on a 
 pedestal plant stand 
 to show it off. Older plants make a bold architectural statement in any room, so put one in a spot where it will get the attention it deserves. Those pointed leaves punctuating the air are something to admire. 
 This plant is extremely easy to grow and is tolerant of changing conditions throughout the year, such as light, humidity and temperature. 
 You can move your yucca plant on the patio for the summer months where it will get some direct sun every day. 
 Outdoors, it may produce tall spikes of fragrant, white flowers. 
  
  
 One thing it doesn't tolerate is soggy soil. 
 Stem and leaf rot may be caused by overwatering or by cool, damp air. 
 Keep this desert native on the dry side, especially in winter. 
 Repot in spring when the plant becomes root-bound. Use a heavy container to prevent toppling, 
 because older plants are top-heavy. Older plants can be top-dressed instead by replacing the top 
 2-3 in (2.5-5 cm) of soil with fresh soil. 
  
 Yucca Plant Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Mexico 
 Height: 
  Up to 5 ft (1.5 m) 
 Light: 
  Prefers bright light to full sun, although it will tolerate low light. 
 Water: 
  Keep soil moist in spring through fall. In winter, water just enough to keep soil from drying out. 
 Be careful not to overwater, especially in winter. 
 Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which can cause root rot. 
 Humidity: 
  Average indoor (around 40% relative humidity). This desert native is tolerant of dry air. 
 Temperature: 
  Average room (65-75°F/18-24°C). If you scoot your plant outdoors for the summer, don't worry -- it can take the heat. But bring it inside when temps drop to 50°F/10°C at night. 
 Soil: 
  Soil-based potting mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer every 2 weeks in spring and summer. Don't feed in autumn and winter, when growth is slower. 
 Propagation: 
  Cane cuttings and offsets root easily. Pot them in potting mix and keep barely moist.

<ol>
<li><b>Repot.</b> Spring is the best time to repot most plants because they're starting their most 
vigorous time of growth. If roots are growing out of the container's drainage holes, give them a bit more space. Follow these steps for <a href="https://www.guide-to-houseplants.com/repotting-
house-plants.html">repotting house plants</a>.</li>

<li><b>Tidy up.</b> Cut off any dead leaves or flowers. Clean dust off leaves to give plants the light they need for photosynthesis. </li>

<li><b>Feed your plant.</b> Increased daylight will make indoor plants grow 
faster. If you stopped fertilizing your plants for the winter, it's time to start again.</li>

 Geranium Care Tips 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Pelargonium x hortorum 
 Easy geranium care and big, colorful clusters of showy blooms make these  
 Pelargoniums 
  favorite flowering plants for 
 containers. 
  
  
  
  
 Whether you're growing geraniums indoors -- or outdoors on your sunny porch or patio --  
 Pelargonium 
  hybrids 
 can't be beat for spectacular vigor and bloom. 
 All summer, you can expect several flowerheads held on succulent stems to cover the plant. 
 The blooms may be single, semidouble or double, and are available in many shades of pink, salmon, red, purple or white. 
  
 Fancy Leaf Geraniums 
  
  
 Scalloped leaf edges and a brown, circular ring -- called a  
 zone 
  -- are the hallmarks of many  
 P. x hortorum 
 varieties. 
 These hybrids are often called zonal geraniums because of the zone leaf patterns. 
 Some zonal cultivars are grown just for their colorful foliage.  
 'Robert Fish' 
 has small, insignificant flowers, but its 
 red, yellow, brown and green leaves are magnificent. 
 'Henry Cox' 
 is another fancy-leafed geranium splashed with gold, red, bronze and green. 
  
 Caring for Geraniums Year-Round 
  
 Let the sun shine. 
  Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. Give your geranium as much light 
 as you can spring through fall, including direct sun. If you're growing geraniums indoors, put the plant in a sunny window. 
 Deadhead geranium flowers. 
  Remove spent flowers to keep your plant looking neat and to promote more blooms. 
 Pinch and prune. 
  Pruning geraniums will force new growth, bringing you more flowers. Use sharp pruners 
 and cut at a 45° angle to 
 avoid tearing the stems, which can attract disease. Cut stems back hard in spring to keep the plant compact. Pinching off 
 the growing tips will encourage branching. 
 Repot in spring. 
  Geraniums bloom best if slightly pot-bound. Move your plant to a pot 1 to 2 inches larger or 
 keep it in the same pot and just give it fresh soil. 
 Winterizing geraniums. 
  Saving geraniums from year to year requires a cool winter rest. These are tender perennials 
 that won't survive the frost. You can overwinter geraniums in a cool basement or garage with a minimum 
 temperature of 50°F/10°C. During this rest, water sparingly, but don't allow soil to dry out completely. Allow the 
 foliage to die back, then cut the stems back hard in spring. 
  
 Green Thumb Tip 
  
 Pale circles on leaves are caused by the fungus rust. 
 Cut off affected stems and leaves. If necessary, spray your plant with a sulfur-based fungicide made to treat rust disease. 
  
  
 With good geranium care, your plant will flower year after year. Geranium propagation from stem cuttings that root 
 readily or from seeds, can easily grow your collection of these gorgeous flowering plants.

 Buying Tip 
  
 You can buy geraniums in garden centers, nurseries and online in spring and summer. Dozens of new hybrids are offered every year, with 
 robust growth and superior flowering. The care of geraniums is easy, so pick as many as you like. 
  
 Geranium Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  South Africa 
 Height: 
  1-3 ft (30-90 cm) 
 Light: 
  Bright light to full sun. 
 Growing geraniums in a sunny spot outdoors for the summer will give it more blooming power. 
 Just be sure to bring it back inside before the temperature drops to 50°F/10°C at night. 
 Try to move your plant back inside gradually. Move it to a shadier spot first to acclimate it to lower light levels. Sudden changes in 
 light will cause the leaves to drop off. When moving your geranium care should be taken not to brush against the 
 flowers because they can easily fall off. 
 Water: 
  Water thoroughly, then allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out before watering again. Cut back on watering 
 in winter, but don't allow the roots to dry out completely. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which can 
 cause root rot. 
 Humidity: 
  Average room (around 40% relative humidity) or higher. 
 Temperature: 
  Cool nights (55-60°F/13-16°C) and warm days (65-75°F/18-24°C) will 
 trigger flower buds. 
 Soil: 
  Peat moss-based soilless mix. 
 Fertilizer: 
  Feed in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus fertilizer 
 to promote blooming. 
 Propagation: 
  Take stem cuttings in spring and early summer and root in fresh potting mix. Geranium seed is 
 easy to grow, too. Sow seeds in early spring.

 Grow Cineraria Flower Indoors 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name: Senecio x hybridus 
 Think of cineraria flower as a living bouquet. 
 You'll find these beautiful bloomers in floral shops in midwinter to early spring. 
 When you're selecting a new cineraria plant, look for one with plenty of unopened flower buds. Yeah, I know they're not as attractive as the fully open flowers; however, you'll enjoy your cineraria plant longer, watching all its flowers bloom. 
  
  
 Choose the color you like. Those daisy-like flowers are available in a range of vibrant colors, including pink, blue, violet blue, purple or red -- often with an inner white ring around the central eye. 
 Keep your plant in a cool location and well-watered, and you'll enjoy its profusion of flowers for about a month or two. 
 Although short-lived, cinerarias are sure to brighten up your home in winter. What could be a better pick-me-up when your outdoor flowerbed is blanketed with snow? Put your plant near a cool east- or north-facing window. Better yet, display three pots together in a windowbox-type planter. 
  
  
  
 Caring for Cineraria Flower Indoors 
  
 Wondering whether to repot? 
  You won't need to because cineraria is a temporary house plant. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, slip it into a cachepot. This type of decorative pot doesn't have drainage holes, so it's a good idea to put pebbles in the bottom to keep the inner pot above the drainage water. 
 Wilted plants 
  are often caused by dry soil. Flowering plants are thirsty, and this is one will collapse if it dries out. Check the soil often and aim to keep it lightly moist at all times. Water thoroughly to wet all the roots, allowing water to drain out the drainage holes. Don't overwater, though. Soggy soil will lead to root rot, which also causes wilting. If your plant gets root rot, just toss it out...it won't recover. 
 Flowers that wither 
  soon after opening are likely caused by hot, dry air. Ideally, keep your cineraria cool -- around 50°F/10°C. Your flowers will last longer with cool temps. In fact, you can move your plant to an enclosed porch or a sunroom for the night, if you want. Don't worry if the temperature drops to 40°F/4°C at night; cinerarias love the cool, moist air. 
 Deadhead spent blooms. 
  Use scissors to remove flowers as they fade. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  It's likely  
 aphids 
 . These tiny insects tend to hang out on stems and flower buds. It's a good idea to look over your plant each time you water. If it is infested,  
 get rid of it 
 . You don't want these pesky critters to spread to your other indoor plants.

 Cineraria Flowering Plant Care Tips 
  
 Origin: 
  Hybrid cultivars developed from Canary Island species 
 Height: 
  1-2 ft (30-60 cm). 'Nana' and 'Jester' varieties are more compact, reaching about 10-inches (25 cm) tall. 
 Light: 
  Bright indirect sunlight; some cool morning sun is fine. Leaves will become pale if they are in direct sunlight, especially in too-hot temperatures. 
 Water: 
  Keep the potting medium lightly moist at all times. Cineraria will quickly wilt when allowed to dry out. Overwatering will cause root rot, which will also make it wilt. If your plant collapses even if you've been watering regularly, it likely has root rot and should be discarded. 
 Humidity: 
  Moderate to high (at least 40% 
 relative humidity). Set pot on a humidity tray or use a cool-mist room humidifier to  
 raise the humidity 
  around the plant. 
 Temperature: 
  Keep your plant in a cool location (50-65°F/10-18°C) to prolong flowering. Cineraria flowers will tolerate a low of 40°F/4°C at night. 
 Soil: 
  Peat-moss based potting mix 
 Fertilizer: 
  Not needed 
 Propagation: 
  Sow cineraria seeds in summer to produce flowering plants the following winter. Keep seeds and seedlings at room temperature and moist, in indirect light. It takes about 4 months to bloom.

 Madagascar Jasmine 
  
  
  
 Botanical Name:  
 Stephanotis floribunda 
  
 Add spectacular fragrance to a room with Madagascar jasmine. It's a beauty, too. Those long thick vines 
 are densely covered with glossy, evergreen leaves and an abundance of white star-shaped flowers. 
  
  
  
 Jasmine-like tubular flowers open up to 5 spreading lobes, anytime from spring to autumn. 
  
 About those Fragrant Flowers 
  
 Clusters of creamy white, tubular flower buds arise from the leaf axils. Give your plant plenty of light, 
 and you can expect a profusion of 5-petaled, waxy flowers from spring through autumn. Each beautifully scented bloom lasts for several days. 
  
 How fragrant? 
  One small plant is enough to fill a whole room with a delightfully sweet scent. Also called Hawaiian Wedding Plant, the pristine white blooms are popular for bridal bouquets. 
 No blooms? 
  Lack of sunlight is the top reason for lack of flowers. Put your jasmine plant 
 in a sunny window, sunroom or greenhouse to give it the light it needs. Young plants may not bloom much, so 
 be patient -- the wait is worth it. 
  
 Stephanotis Floribunda Problems, Solutions and To-Dos 
  
 Prune it back. 
 After the flowers fade, prune stems back harshly. Plants that aren't pruned back will 
 eventually have bare lower stems as they shed old leaves. Flower buds develop on new growth, so you'll get more 
 blooms this way. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Prune back in late fall or early winter to control its size 
 and to prevent bare stems. It's a good idea to keep the vine to around 2-3 ft (60-90 cm). 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
  only when the roots have filled the pot. Madagascar jasmine blooms best when slightly pot-bound, so 
 use a smallish container or you may see a lot of leaves and few flowers. 
 Support your vines 
 . You can easily train it around a hoop or over a small  
 trellis 
  inserted in the pot. 
 Tie it to the support with florist wire as it grows. 
 Flowers falling off? 
  Dropped flower buds and flowers may be caused by sudden changes in light, temperature or moisture. See care tips below. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Wet, peaty potting mixtures may draw  
 fungus gnats 
 . They're tiny and black -- hardly noticeable, but you may see them stirring when you water your plant. Look under the leaves and you may find  
 scale insects 
 . You can scrape them off with your fingernail, but it's also a good idea to treat any infested plant with insecticide. 
 Yellow leaves? 
  You overwatered. 
 Use a pot with drainage holes for water to escape. 
 Allow the top couple inches of the potting medium to dry out before watering again. You can cut off any yellow leaves, if you want. This vigorous vine will replace them. 
  
 Madagascar Jasmine Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) or more, if not pruned back. 
 Light: 
 Jasmine needs bright, indirect light to bloom. Shade from hot, direct summer sun. Once it grows flower buds, don't move Madagascar jasmine around; changes in light -- even by turning the plant around -- may cause the buds and flowers to fall off. 
 Water: 
 Spring through fall, water thoroughly until water comes out the bottom of the pot. Allow the soil 
 to dry out a bit before watering again. Keep barely moist in winter, after flowering is over. If the plant wilts, it's too dry. Overwatering 
 will cause leaves to turn yellow and fall off. 
 Humidity: 
 Ideally 60%. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a  
 room humidifier or humidity tray 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Give this tropical jasmine warm temperatures (65-75°F/16-24°C) year-round. It will 
 tolerate temps down to 50°F/10°C.  
 Stephanotis floribunda 
  doesn't like fluctuating temps, so keep them away from drafty windows and doors, or heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix with a handful of perlite or horticultural sand  added to improve drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Stem cuttings do not root easily, but here's how: Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in early summer, dip cut 
 ends in hormone  
 rooting powder 
  and stand them in moist perlite. Maintain warmth (75°F/24°C) for the cuttings; it's a good idea to use a seedling heat mat. Sow seeds in spring.

 be patient -- the wait is worth it. 
  
 Stephanotis Floribunda Problems, Solutions and To-Dos 
  
 Prune it back. 
 After the flowers fade, prune stems back harshly. Plants that aren't pruned back will 
 eventually have bare lower stems as they shed old leaves. Flower buds develop on new growth, so you'll get more 
 blooms this way. 
  
 Pruning tip: 
  Prune back in late fall or early winter to control its size 
 and to prevent bare stems. It's a good idea to keep the vine to around 2-3 ft (60-90 cm). 
  
  
 Repot in spring 
  only when the roots have filled the pot. Madagascar jasmine blooms best when slightly pot-bound, so 
 use a smallish container or you may see a lot of leaves and few flowers. 
 Support your vines 
 . You can easily train it around a hoop or over a small  
 trellis 
  inserted in the pot. 
 Tie it to the support with florist wire as it grows. 
 Flowers falling off? 
  Dropped flower buds and flowers may be caused by sudden changes in light, temperature or moisture. See care tips below. 
 Something bugging your plant? 
  Wet, peaty potting mixtures may draw  
 fungus gnats 
 . They're tiny and black -- hardly noticeable, but you may see them stirring when you water your plant. Look under the leaves and you may find  
 scale insects 
 . You can scrape them off with your fingernail, but it's also a good idea to treat any infested plant with insecticide. 
 Yellow leaves? 
  You overwatered. 
 Use a pot with drainage holes for water to escape. 
 Allow the top couple inches of the potting medium to dry out before watering again. You can cut off any yellow leaves, if you want. This vigorous vine will replace them. 
  
 Madagascar Jasmine Care Tips 
  
  
 Origin: 
  Madagascar 
 Height: 
 Up to 10 ft (3 m) or more, if not pruned back. 
 Light: 
 Jasmine needs bright, indirect light to bloom. Shade from hot, direct summer sun. Once it grows flower buds, don't move Madagascar jasmine around; changes in light -- even by turning the plant around -- may cause the buds and flowers to fall off. 
 Water: 
 Spring through fall, water thoroughly until water comes out the bottom of the pot. Allow the soil 
 to dry out a bit before watering again. Keep barely moist in winter, after flowering is over. If the plant wilts, it's too dry. Overwatering 
 will cause leaves to turn yellow and fall off. 
 Humidity: 
 Ideally 60%. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a  
 room humidifier or humidity tray 
 . 
 Temperature: 
 Give this tropical jasmine warm temperatures (65-75°F/16-24°C) year-round. It will 
 tolerate temps down to 50°F/10°C.  
 Stephanotis floribunda 
  doesn't like fluctuating temps, so keep them away from drafty windows and doors, or heat/AC vents. 
 Soil: 
 Peat moss-based potting mix with a handful of perlite or horticultural sand  added to improve drainage. 
 Fertilizer: 
 Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer. 
 Propagation: 
 Stem cuttings do not root easily, but here's how: Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in early summer, dip cut 
 ends in hormone  
 rooting powder 
  and stand them in moist perlite. Maintain warmth (75°F/24°C) for the cuttings; it's a good idea to use a seedling heat mat. Sow seeds in spring.

 How Well Do You Know 
 Your House Plants? 
  
  
  
 Have you ever despaired over crispy ivy? Or wondered what it takes to get a cactus to bloom? 
 House plants can seem like a mystery if you don't know how to care for them. 
 With information now at your fingertips, it's easy to find out about your plant, discover what it needs, and get the most out of it. 
 I promise you'll be rewarded with a healthy, thriving houseplant that's a source of pride and joy for years to come. 
  
  
  
  
 Everything you need is here in this user-friendly house plant guide: 
  
 Look up your plant in the  
 Encyclopedia A-Z 
  and find out how to care for it. 
 Suggestions for  
 easy house plants 
  -- including 10 House Plants You Can't Kill. 
 Check out  
 pests and diseases 
  and find out what to do about spider mites, fungus, aphids and other things that are bugging your houseplants. 
 Take a look at this list of  
 poisonous plants 
  and keep your family and pets safe. 
 Bring the beauty of the tropics to you with these  
 tropical house plants 
 . 
  
 Blooming hyacinths add more than beauty,  they are delightfully fragrant, too. 
  
 Bring on Spring! 
  
 Who says we have to wait to enjoy beautiful flowers? 
  
 Spring has already sprung in florists shops everywhere. 
  
 You'll find the sunny trumpet-shaped blooms of  
 mini daffodils 
  popping up along side gorgeous pink, purple or red  
 tulips 
 . 
  
   
 Hyacinths 
  add more than beauty to your indoor landscape...its blooms are delightfully fragrant. 
  
 Take Indoor Plants to New Heights 
  
 Put them on a pedestal. 
  
 Indoor plantstands 
  are a simple solution for displaying several small plants together. With a multi-level stand, you can easily transform a jungle into an eye-catching arrangement. 
 Hang 'em high. 
  Pot them up in  
 indoor plant hangers 
  and they'll be at eye level for all to admire. 
 Drive them up a wall. 
  
 Vertical gardens 
 are perhaps the newest trend in indoor gardening. Check out these planters that make hanging them a breeze. 
  
  
 Spring Checklist 
  
  
 Prune. 
  Pruning long vines will help them to branch out, creating a fuller plant. Got a plant that's getting too big? 
Some can be lopped off without harming them, some can't. Look up your plant in the  
 house plants encyclopedia 
  to find out if, 
when and how to prune your plant. 
  
 Clean leaves. 
  Give plants the light they need to grow by removing built-up dust on foliage. Cleaning also helps to get 
rid of insect eggs. Use a damp cloth to gently wipe off leaves, top and bottom. Fine foliage (like Boston fern fronds) 
are difficult to wipe clean, so just spray them with tepid water to remove dust. 
  
 Repot. 
  Spring is the best time to repot most plants because they're starting their most 
vigorous time of growth. If roots are growing out of the container's drainage holes, give them a bit more space. 
Follow these steps for  
 repotting house plants 
 . 
  
 Check for bugs. 
  Look over plant stems and leaves at least once a week. Check under leaves, too (a favorite hiding place for tiny critters). Take a look at  
 house plant pests 
  to identify common insects and find out how to get rid of them. 
  
 Tidy up. 
  Cut off any dead leaves or flowers. They not only look unsightly, they can attract mold and insects. 
Cutting off spent flowers encourages more blooms. 
  
 Flush out salts. 
  Get rid of white, crusty build-up on the potting mix by slowly pouring tepid water over 
the potting mix. Allow water to run through the pot, then pour more water. Empty drainage tray. You can skip this task 
if you're repotting. 
  
 Feed your plant. 
  Increased daylight will make indoor plants grow faster. If you stopped fertilizing your 
plants for the winter, it's time to start again. 
  
  
  
 Indoor Herb Garden 
  
 A dash of oregano and a pinch of parsley is only an armslength away when you grow fresh culinary herbs in your kitchen. 
  
 Herbs need at least 6 hours of sunlight a day, making them ideal for a sunny kitchen window. 
  
 Don't have a sunny spot? Set pots under  
 a grow light 
 , keeping the light 6 inches above the tops of the plants for about 14 hours a day. 
  
 Take a look at  
 indoor herb gardens 
  for ideas on what to grow, plus all the how-tos for successfully growing herbs. Make it easy on yourself with an  
 herb kit 
  that takes away all the guesswork. 
  
 Office Plants

  are good for you? 
 Okay, they won't bring your coffee, but they will boost your mood and create an instant garden ambiance right there on your desk. 
 Check these out. It's never been easier to find a few good candidates to share your office space.

 About Guide to Houseplants 
  
  
  
 Welcome! I'm Christine, avid gardener, writer and owner of Guide-to-Houseplants.com. 
 I started this website to share my knowledge and passion for house plants. The most 
 satisfying for me are those that stretch my skills, or at least teach me something new. I 
 especially love tropical plants -- for their exotic beauty and sometimes the challenge of 
 keeping them healthy indoors. 
  
  
  
  
 My Budding Passion 
  
 I've had an interest in gardening for as long as I can remember. I sowed flower seeds from packets, dutifully sprinkled them with water (when I remembered) and let nature do the rest. Beautiful rows of snapdragons, zinnias, and bachelor's buttons thrived outdoors. My early gardening success came easily, and I was encouraged. 
 Step indoors... 
 My interest in indoor plants began when I was about 10 years old. Houseplants were hot in the 70s and I loved the jungle look indoors. My first  
 victims 
  houseplants included a spider plant 
 dangling from a 
 macramé hanger 
 , a small cactus on the windowsill, and an asparagus fern I started from seed 
 . Some actually survived...for a while. I can still picture the dried, brown leaflets of the asparagus fern scattered across the shag carpet 
 . Ugh. 
 I learned a lot by trial and error. As I got older, I started researching these tropical and desert plants to learn how they grow in their native habitats. As I got to know them, my interest grew even more. 
  
 Why I Started this Website 
  
 As I discovered early on, I had to get to know the plants -- and find out what they want -- to keep them  
 alive 
  thriving indoors. 
 Unfortunately, finding care information on houseplants was limited to coffee table books (you know, pretty pictures and not much help)... or botany texts telling way too much about plant parts and nothing about how to grow them indoors. Online references were disappointing, too. Facts were limited to telling me whether a plant flowers or not, that it likes "moderate" humidity, "average" water and "medium" light. Huh? 
 Well, I rolled up my sleeves, dug in, and got to work, researching hundreds of plants from hundreds (okay, maybe just dozens) of books -- and talked to the growers, botanists and other pros who guided me (a big "Thank you!") along my exhilarating gardening path. 
 I'm sharing my many-decades experience and findings here online to help others who may struggle to help their houseplants thrive. 
  
 Still Growing 
  
 Guide-to-Houseplants.com got its start in 2008, and was among the first websites devoted to growing plants indoors. Back then, I thought I was one of the few who "still" had a passion for houseplants. Boy, has its popularity grown! Today, the site reaches MORE THAN A MILLION houseplant enthusiasts every year. 
 And it has captured attention from the media as well.
